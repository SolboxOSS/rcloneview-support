# Mega S4 White Label Explorer (Preview)

This page is a private preview of how RcloneView can be delivered as a fully branded **Mega S4 Explorer** desktop application for your users.

The goal of this white-label proposal is to:

- Put the **Mega S4 brand front-and-center** across the entire product.
- Make it **effortless for users to connect their Mega S4 account** immediately after installation.
- Ensure **Mega S4 is the first choice** in every management and navigation workflow.
- Provide **priority support and maintenance** specifically for Mega S4-branded deployments.

---

## 1. Brand Kit & Visual Integration

We provide a brand kit where Mega S4 is the primary and visible brand throughout the product. All RcloneView branding is removed or kept only where legally required (e.g., internal version strings).

Key elements:

- Application name set to **“Mega S4 Explorer”** (or another agreed label).
- All RcloneView logos replaced by the **Mega S4 logo**:
  - Desktop shortcuts and taskbar icons.
  - Installer icons.
  - In-app header and window icon.
- Color accents adjusted to match Mega S4’s brand palette where appropriate.

## 2. Post‑Install Mega S4 Remote Wizard

Immediately after installation, users are guided to connect their Mega S4 account so they can start using the service without additional setup steps.

Main behaviors:

- At the end of the setup wizard, launching the app opens **“Add Mega S4 Remote”** as the default onboarding flow.
- The wizard is simplified and pre-configured for Mega S4:
  - Provider type is pre-selected as **Mega S4**.
  - Only Mega S4‑specific options are shown by default.
  - Advanced options remain available behind an **“Show advanced options”** link.

### On-Home Quick Access Wizard

If the user skips the initial connection or closes the wizard:

- The right-hand panel of the home screen shows a **large Mega S4 tile**.
- Clicking the tile reopens the **“Add Mega S4 Remote”** wizard at any time.

This ensures that connecting Mega S4 is always the most visible next action for new or returning users.

## 3. Mega S4‑First Navigation & Management

Once a Mega S4 remote is added, the UI is optimized to keep Mega S4 prominently visible across all key navigation and management screens.

### 3.1 Mega S4 Panel Pinned on Re‑Launch

After a Mega S4 remote has been configured:

- On subsequent launches, the UI opens with a **Mega S4 panel pinned** by default.
- Typical layout:
  - Left side: local disk or another source.
  - Right side: the user’s **MYMegaS4** remote.
- Users can freely rearrange panels via drag-and-drop, so the Mega S4 panel can be moved between the left and right sides depending on their preferred workflow.
- This makes repeated sync or copy operations between local folders and Mega S4 a one-click action, regardless of which side the Mega S4 panel is currently on.

### 3.2 Mega S4 First in “New Remote” & “Remote Manager”

To highlight Mega S4 as a primary storage provider:

- In the **New Remote** dialog:
  - Mega S4 appears at the **top of the provider list**.
  - Mega S4 tile is visually highlighted to encourage selection.
- In **Remote Manager**:
  - The Mega S4 remote (e.g., `MYMegaS4`) is displayed at the **top of the remote list**.
  - In both list and card views, the Mega S4 remote is visually emphasized for quicker access.
