# Google Drive to External Rclone on AWS EC2 (Without Web Browser)

This guide explains how to add a **Google Drive remote** to an **external Rclone instance** running on a system where a web browser is not availableâ€”such as an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu server**.

In such environments, completing the standard OAuth login flow via browser is not possible. Instead, you can use a local RcloneView installation to obtain the required **OAuth token**, and then reuse it on the external Rclone running on EC2.

:::info Run Rclone Daemon on EC2
For instructions on how to install and run Rclone on an EC2 instance, 

see: ðŸ‘‰ [How to Run Rclone Engine on AWS EC2](../cloud-storage-setting/run-rclone-on-aws-ec2.md)

:::

The process involves performing an OAuth login on your **local RcloneView** using the embedded Rclone engine, then copying the resulting OAuth token and using it to configure the remote on the external EC2-based Rclone.

## âœ… Step 1: Connect Google Drive via Embedded Rclone (with Browser OAuth)

Follow this guide on your **local machine with browser access** to set up Google Drive using the embedded Rclone:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Quick Guide: Add Google Drive Remote](../intro.md#step-2-adding-remote-storage-google-drive-example)

Once added successfully, you will be able to retrieve the required OAuth token.

---

## âœ… Step 2: Copy the OAuth Access Token

1. In **`Remote Manager`**, locate the connected Google Drive remote.
2. Click **`Edit`** to open its settings.
3. In the **`Options`** tab, scroll down and click **`Show advanced options`**.
4. Copy the content of the **`Token`** field. This contains the OAuth credentials that will be reused on the external Rclone.

## âœ… Step 3: Connect to the External Rclone (EC2)

Open a **`new window`** or use your current session in RcloneView to connect to your EC2-hosted Rclone:

- Open `Settings` â†’ **`Connection Manager`** to either create a new connection to your EC2-hosted Rclone or connect to an existing one if already configured.

## âœ… Step 4: Add Google Drive Remote to the External Rclone

1. In the EC2-connected window, go to the `Remote` menu and select **`+ New Remote`**.
2. Choose **Google Drive** as the provider.
3. In the **`Options`** tab, scroll to the bottom and click **`Show advanced options`**.
4. Paste the previously copied **OAuth Token** into the **`Token`** field.
5. Complete the setup as usual.

Once configured, your EC2-based Rclone can now access Google Drive even without browser support. You can manage, sync, and transfer files using RcloneView as usual.
