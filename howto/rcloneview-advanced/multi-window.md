# Using Multiple Rclone Connections with New Window

RcloneView provides a flexible interface to manage multiple Rclone instances simultaneously. This is particularly useful when working with both embedded and external Rclone setups.

## Embedded Rclone Architecture

In the default configuration, RcloneView includes a built-in Rclone binary (Embedded Rclone). This instance allows users to manage cloud remotes through an easy-to-use GUI interface.

### üîπ Embedded Model

- RcloneView includes Rclone and communicates with it via API.
- Files are accessed and managed directly through Rclone.
- Suitable for most local desktop usage scenarios.

## External Rclone Architecture

For more advanced use cases, such as managing remotes on remote servers or cloud instances, RcloneView can connect to an external Rclone instance running elsewhere.

### üîπ External Model

- RcloneView connects to a remote Rclone server (via Rclone RC).
- Remote Rclone is responsible for accessing and syncing cloud storage.
- Useful for managing cloud-hosted Rclone environments (e.g., AWS EC2, Linux servers).

## New Window Feature: Managing Both Models

To support both embedded and external Rclone instances simultaneously, RcloneView includes a **New Window** feature. This allows users to launch multiple GUI instances of RcloneView, each connected to a different Rclone backend.

### ‚úÖ Key Benefits

- Each window can connect to a unique Rclone instance.
- Manage local and remote environments in parallel.
- Compare, sync, and copy between different clouds or environments seamlessly.

### üî∏ Example: Home Window (Embedded Rclone)

This window is connected to the built-in Rclone included with RcloneView.

:::important Home Icon for the Main Window
The main RcloneView window (connected to the embedded Rclone) can be identified by the **home icon** <img src="/support/icons/home-icon.png" alt="home icon" class="inline-icon" /> located next to the RcloneView logo in the top-right corner.

### üî∏ Example: New Window (External Rclone)

This window is connected to an external Rclone running on an AWS Linux server.

## üö©Comparison: Embedded Rclone vs. External Rclone

| Feature                               | Embedded Rclone                      | External Rclone                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Runs on Local Machine                 | ‚úÖ Yes                                | ‚ùå No (Runs on remote server)                |
| Access to Local Disk                  | Yes ‚Äî Local PC where RcloneView runs | Yes ‚Äî Server where external Rclone runs     |
| Uses Built-in Rclone Binary           | ‚úÖ Included by default                | ‚ùå Requires separate installation            |
| Configurable in `Settings > Location` | ‚úÖ Supported                          | ‚ùå Not applicable                            |
| Requires Network Configuration        | ‚ùå No                                 | ‚úÖ Yes (Host, Port, Authentication required) |
| Network Performance                   | Depends on local/home network        | Depends on server/cloud network             |

 üí° Use the **New Window** feature to manage multiple Rclone instances in parallel ‚Äî for example, connect one window to the embedded Rclone for local tasks, and another to an external Rclone for cloud-side operations.
