## Mount Remote Storage in RcloneView

RcloneView allows you to mount remote storage as a virtual drive for easier access and management.  
This guide explains how to mount remote storage using two methods and manage mount configurations.

### Method 1: Mount from Remote Explorer

You can mount a remote folder directly while browsing its contents.

1. In the **Remote Explorer** pane, select the remote folder you want to mount. 
2. Click the **Mount icon** (<img src="/support/icons/mount-icon.png" alt="mount icon" class="inline-icon" />) at the top corner of the Remote Explorer pane.
3. The **Mount** dialog will open with the selected remote path automatically filled in.
4. Configure the mount settings:
   - **Target**: Choose `Auto` or manually assign a driver letter manually from the list.
   - (optional) check "Mount to local path" to specify a custom mount location.
   - Enable **Auto mount** to automatically mount this remote when RcloneView starts.
5. Click **Save and mount** to apply the settings and mount immediately.
   - Alternatively, click **Save** to just save the mount configuration and mount it later.

| Field                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Volume name**    | (Optional) Set a custom name for the mounted volume. This may be shown in your file manager or system UI.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Mount type**     | Select the mount backend: <br /> - `cmount` (default for Windows):  Uses Rclone's internal C-based FUSE-like mount engine with high compatibility  <br />- `nfsmount` (alternative, mostly for Linux/macOS environments).  Uses the NFS protocol to mount the remote |
| **Network drive**  | Check this box to mark the mount as a network drive. This may affect how the OS treats the mounted folder.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Read only**      | Enables read-only mode, preventing write operations to the remote.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Allow other**    | Allow access to the mounted filesystem by users other than the one who mounted it (mostly used in Linux).                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Cache mode**     | Controls the caching behavior. Options include:  <br />- `off`  <br />- `minimal`  <br />- `writes`  <br />- `full`  <br />The default `writes` mode caches write operations.                                                                                              |
| **Cache max size** | Maximum allowed cache size in bytes.  <br />Example: 1073741824 = 1GB.  <br />Set to `-1` for no limit.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cache max age**  | How long cached data can stay valid.  Time unit is in **nanoseconds**.  Example: 3600000000000 = 1 hour.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Dir cache time** | Directory cache validity time.  Time unit is in **nanoseconds**.  Example: 300000000000 = 5 minutes.                                                                                                                                                   |

ðŸ’¡ Use these options only if you are familiar with mount settings. The default values work well for most users.
