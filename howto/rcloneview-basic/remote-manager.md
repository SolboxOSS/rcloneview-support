# Add and Manage Remote Storages in RcloneView

RcloneView allows you to connect and manage both cloud and local storage services.  
This guide explains how to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** remote storages using RcloneView.

## Add a New Remote
  
You can add a new remote storage by first opening the **New Remote** dialog and then completing the setup.

### Open the **New Remote** Dialog

You can open the **`New Remote`** setup dialog using one of the following methods:

<div class="img-grid-3">
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-remote-top-remote-menu.png" alt="create remote top remote menu" class="img-medium img-center" />
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-remote-by-plus-button.png" alt="create remote by plus button" class="img-medium img-center" />
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-remote-by-remote-manager.png" alt="create remote by remote manager" class="img-medium img-center" />
</div>

#### Method 1: Use the Top Remote Menu

Click **`+ New Remote`** on the top Remote tab.

#### Method 2: Use the `+` Button in the Explorer Pane

Click the **`+`** icon in the file explorer panel (either left or right), then select **New Remote**.

#### Method 3: Use the Remote Manager

Click the **`Remote Manager`** button from the **`Remote`** tab, then click the **`+`** button on an empty remote card.


### Set Up the New Remote

Once the **New Remote** dialog opens, select the remote type (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, S3) and fill in the required settings.  

The fields will vary depending on the selected provider.

For detailed provider-specific instructions, please refer to [**Remote Storage Connection Settings**](../remote-storage-connection-settings/intro.md).  

## Managing Existing Remotes in RcloneView

Once you've added remotes to RcloneView, you can manage them in various ways — including opening, editing, or deleting them. Below is a guide explaining how to perform each action.

### Open Remote in Explorer Panel

You can open a remote’s folder view to browse or transfer files between local and cloud.

<div class="img-grid-3">
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/open-remote-by-remote-card.png" alt="open remote by remote card" class="img-medium img-center" />
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/open-remote-by-plus-button.png" alt="open remote by plus button" class="img-medium img-center" />
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/open-remote-by-remote-manager.png" alt="open remote by remote manager" class="img-medium img-center" />
</div>

#### Method 1: Click `Open` Button on the Remote Card

Click the **`Open`** button on any remote card from the right-side pane.

#### Method 2: Open Remote Using the Explorer Pane's `+` Button

Clicking the **`+`** button located in either the left or right **Explorer pane** will display a list of all currently configured remotes.

1. Click the `+` icon in the Explorer pane where you want to open the remote.
2. A dropdown list will appear showing all available remotes.
3. Select the desired remote (e.g., `MyWebDAV`) from the list.
4. The selected remote will open in the clicked pane. If another remote is already opened there, a **new tab** will be added for the selected remote.

:::note
 Remotes marked as **favorites (aliases)** are shown at the **top of the list** for quicker access.
:::
#### Method 3: Use Remote Manager's `Open` Button

1. Click the **Remote Manager** button in the toolbar.
2. From the Remote Manager dialog, find the desired remote.
3. Click **`Open`** to open it in a file browser pane.

:::tip Quick Access from System Tray
You can quickly open a remote by clicking the RcloneView icon in the system tray and selecting a remote from the list.

### Edit Remote Settings


You can modify the settings of an existing remote using one of the following methods:

<div class="img-grid-2">
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/edit-remote-from-explorer-panel.png" alt="edit remote from explorer panel" class="img-medium img-center" />
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/edit-remote-from-remote-manager.png" alt="edit remote from remote manager" class="img-medium img-center" />
</div>


#### Method 1: Edit from the Explorer Panel  

If you're currently browsing a remote in the **Explorer Panel**, click the **gear icon (⚙️)** located in the upper-right corner of the active remote panel.

This opens the **Edit Remote** dialog, where you can update the **Provider** and **Options** values of the selected remote.  

 ⚠️ **Note:** You cannot rename the remote here.


#### Method 2: Edit from the Remote Manager  

1. Click the **Remote Manager** button in the main toolbar under the **Remote** menu.  
2. In the **Remote Manager** window, locate the remote you wish to edit.  
3. Click the **Edit** button on the remote card to open the **Edit Remote** dialog.

This method also allows you to change the **Provider** and **Options**, but the **remote name** remains fixed.


### Delete a Remote


If you no longer need a configured remote, you can safely delete it using the **Remote Manager**.

<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/delete-remote.png" alt="delete remote" class="img-medium img-center" />

1. From the **Remote** tab in the top menu, click the **Remote Manager** button in the toolbar.
2. In the **Remote Manager** window, locate the remote you want to remove.
3. Click the **`Delete`** button on the corresponding remote card.

This action will:
- Permanently remove the remote from your configuration.
- Automatically close it from the Explorer pane if it’s currently opened.
