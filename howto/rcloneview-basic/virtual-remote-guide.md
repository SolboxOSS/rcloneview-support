# Virtual Remote Overview and Setup

Virtual Remotes add functional layers on top of existing cloud remotes. They do not store data themselves; instead, they make your current remotes more convenient, faster, safer, or more flexible.

---

## What is a Virtual Remote?

A Virtual Remote is a feature layer that:

- Extends existing remotes without moving data.
- Keeps storage in the original remote while adding convenience.
- Helps with faster access, privacy, or unified views.

---

## Types of Virtual Remotes

RcloneView provides nine Virtual Remote types:

1. **Alias**  
   Shortcut to jump directly to a specific cloud folder.  
   Example: bookmark a deep Google Drive path for instant access.  
   👉 See: [Alias Remote Guide](../remote-storage-connection-settings/alias-remote.md)

2. **Crypt**  
   Encrypt filenames, contents, and folders for privacy.  
   👉 See: [Crypt Remote Guide](../remote-storage-connection-settings/crypt-remote.md)

3. **Memory**  
   Stores data in RAM for ultra-fast temporary usage; clears when closed.

4. **Cache**  
   Speeds up slow remotes with caching; faster repeated reads and streaming.

5. **Chunker**  
   Splits large files into chunks to bypass service size limits and improve stability.

6. **Combine**  
   Shows multiple folders under one remote as separate subfolders.  
   👉 See: [Combine Remote Guide](../remote-storage-connection-settings/combine-remote.md)

7. **Union**  
   Merges multiple folders into one unified view.  
   👉 See: [Union Remote Guide](../remote-storage-connection-settings/union-remote.md)

8. **Hasher**  
   Adds hashing where the backend lacks it; useful for integrity checks.

9. **Compress**  
   Compresses files before upload to save space.

## How to Add a Virtual Remote

All Virtual Remotes are created from **New Remote > Virtual**.

### Step 1 — Open New Remote

- From the top menu: **`Remote` > `New Remote`**.
- Choose the **`Virtual`** tab to see all Virtual Remote types.

### Step 2 — Pick the Virtual Remote type

Each type has its own required fields. Examples:

- **Alias**: name + target folder.
- **Crypt**: encryption password + target folder.
- **Union**: multiple `Remote:Path` upstreams.
- **Combine**: directory labels + remote paths list.
- **Chunker**: source remote + chunk settings.

RcloneView guides you through the required inputs for each type.

### Step 3 — Use the Virtual Remote

After creation, the Virtual Remote appears just like any remote in:

- **Remote Manager**
- **Explorer** file browser
- **Sync / Compare / Job** dialogs

Remember: Virtual Remotes are feature layers. Actual files stay in the underlying remote paths.
