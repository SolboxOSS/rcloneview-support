# File Management with RcloneView

RcloneView allows you to easily browse, transfer, and organize files between your local disk and multiple cloud storage services using a familiar, Explorer-like interface. 

This guide walks you through:

- Browsing remote storage
- Copying files using drag & drop
- Managing files with the right-click menu
 
## Browsing Remote Storage

You can open any connected cloud remote and view it like a local folder.

### How to Browse a Remote:

1. Click the **`+`** tab in the **Explorer panel**.
2. Select the remote storage you want to open.
3. The selected remote will open in a new tab, ready for file operations.

## Copying Files using Drag and Drop

You can transfer files between local and cloud storage using simple drag & drop.
#### Copy Between Two Remotes

Drag files from one remote tab to another in RcloneView to copy them across cloud storages.

**ðŸ‘‰  For Multi-Select and Bulk Actions**
You can select multiple files at once to perform batch operations.
- Use **`Ctrl + Click`** to select multiple individual files.
- Use **`Shift + Click`** to select a range of files.

**ðŸ‘‰  Drag & Drop Behavior **
- **Same remote** = Move operation Â 
- **Different remotes** = Copy operation


:::tip Hint
-  If you donâ€™t want to see the confirmation popup during copy, uncheck the **Confirm drag and drop** checkbox.
- To re-enable the popup later, go to **Settings > General settings > Confirm drag and drop** and check it again.

#### Copy from Windows Explorer to Remote in RcloneView
- You can also drag files directly from **Windows File Explorer** into a RcloneView tab to upload them to the cloud storage.
