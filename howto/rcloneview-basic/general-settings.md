# General Settings

RcloneView's **Settings** menu is divided into four tabs for better clarity and customization:

- **General**
- **Interfaces & Notifications**
- **Embedded Rclone**
- **Network & Misc.**

Each tab allows you to configure different parts of the application. Below is a breakdown of each section.
