# Migration from AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2 with RcloneView

In today‚Äôs cloud-driven landscape, organizations and developers often seek to optimize storage costs, avoid vendor lock-in, and improve data accessibility. **Amazon S3** has long been the industry standard for object storage, offering high durability and seamless integration with AWS services. However, as data transfer volumes grow, S3‚Äôs egress fees and complex billing can become a significant burden.

**Cloudflare R2** emerges as a compelling alternative‚Äîdelivering S3-compatible storage with no egress fees, a transparent pricing model, and global performance through Cloudflare‚Äôs vast edge network. Migrating from S3 to R2 allows you to:

- **Eliminate egress fees** and reduce overall cloud storage costs
- **Avoid vendor lock-in** with S3 API compatibility and flexible multi-cloud setups
- **Leverage Cloudflare‚Äôs global edge** for faster, more reliable data access
- **Simplify billing** and management with a user-friendly dashboard

Manual migration between cloud platforms is tedious and error-prone. That‚Äôs where **RcloneView** makes a difference.
