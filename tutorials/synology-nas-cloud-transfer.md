# Effortless Synology NAS Integration with RcloneView: Auto-Detection, Setup & File Transfer

  Easily connect your Synology NAS to cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud using **RcloneView**. With auto-detection, built-in support for SMB, WebDAV, and SFTP, and no complex setup required, you can transfer, sync, or schedule jobs between your NAS and cloud drives‚Äîall from a user-friendly GUI.

## **‚úÖ Why Use RcloneView for NAS-to-Cloud Transfers?**

If you‚Äôre using Synology NAS as your home server, office backup, or media vault, chances are you‚Äôve also got cloud storage accounts. With RcloneView, you don‚Äôt need to rely on downloading files manually or learning command-line tools.

Instead, you get:

- üöÄ Auto-detection of NAS devices in your local network
    
- üîÑ Sync & transfer jobs between NAS and cloud storage
    
- üë®‚Äçüíª GUI-based setup for WebDAV, SMB, FTP, and SFTP
    
- üìÖ Schedule automated backup jobs from NAS to cloud
    
- ‚úÖ Compare folder contents before syncing
    
- üß† No command-line skills required
  

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or a system administrator, **RcloneView makes NAS-to-cloud management simple**.

## **üß∞ Step 1: Detect Your NAS on Local Network**
  

RcloneView automatically scans your local network for Synology NAS devices.

- Make sure your NAS and computer are on the **same local network**.
    
- NAS devices detected will appear in a list showing:
    
    - Device name, IP, MAC address, DSM port
        
    - Link to open **DSM (DiskStation Manager)**


:::info NAS Auto-Detection Not Working on VLAN
If you're using a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), RcloneView may not be able to auto-detect your Synology NAS. ¬†

This is because the auto-discovery feature relies on multicast or broadcast protocols, which are typically restricted or blocked between VLANs for security and traffic isolation reasons.

### Select a Connection Method

  From the dropdown, choose how to connect:

- **WebDAV** (default and recommended)
- **SMB**
- **FTP**
- **SFTP**

**üîó Need to configure these on Synology first?**

Refer to the official DSM setup guides:

- [Set up WebDAV on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/WebDAVServer/webdav_server)
- [Enable SMB on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SMBService/smbservice_smb_settings)
- [Set up FTP on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_ftp_setting) 
- [Set up SFTP on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_ftp_sftp) 

:::important Port Forwarding & DDNS Configuration

If your NAS . s behind a router or operating in a NAT (Network Address Translation) environment, you must **configure port forwarding** on your router after enabling WebDAV, SMB, FTP, or SFTP in DSM.

Additionally, to access your NAS over the internet using **domain-based access instead of IP address**, you can configure Synology‚Äôs **DDNS (Dynamic DNS)** service.

## **üîó Step 2: Add Synology NAS as a Remote**

After selecting your NAS and connection method, RcloneView will automatically guide you through the **`+ New Remote`** wizard:

- **Provider** is automatically selected based on your chosen connection method (e.g., WebDAV, SMB, SFTP).
- **Remote Name** is auto-filled (e.g., `Synology-28`) ‚Äî but you can change it if you'd like.
- **URL & Port**:  
  - For **WebDAV**, enter the full URL (e.g., `https://abc.synology.me:5006`)  
  - For **SMB / FTP / SFTP**, enter the **host** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) and appropriate **port**:
    - `445` for SMB  
    - `21` for FTP  
    - `22` for SFTP
- **Username and Password**: Enter the NAS account credentials you use to access shared folders.
