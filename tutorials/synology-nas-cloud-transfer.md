# Effortless Synology NAS Integration with RcloneView: Auto-Detection, Setup & File Transfer

Easily connect your Synology NAS to cloud services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud using **RcloneView**. With auto-detection, built-in support for SMB, WebDAV, and SFTP, and no complex setup required, you can transfer, sync, or schedule jobs between your NAS and cloud drives—all from a user-friendly GUI.

## **✅ Why Use RcloneView for NAS-to-Cloud Transfers?**

If you’re using Synology NAS as your home server, office backup, or media vault, chances are you’ve also got cloud storage accounts. With RcloneView, you don’t need to rely on downloading files manually or learning command-line tools.

Instead, you get:

- 🚀 Auto-detection of NAS devices in your local network
    
- 🔄 Sync & transfer jobs between NAS and cloud storage
    
- 👨‍💻 GUI-based setup for WebDAV, SMB, FTP, and SFTP
    
- 📅 Schedule automated backup jobs from NAS to cloud
    
- ✅ Compare folder contents before syncing
    
- 🧠 No command-line skills required
  

Whether you’re a beginner or a system administrator, **RcloneView makes NAS-to-cloud management simple**.

## **🧰 Step 1: Detect Your NAS on Local Network**
  

RcloneView automatically scans your local network for Synology NAS devices.

<img src="/support/images/en/tutorials/synology-nas-auto-detect.png" alt="synology nas auto detect" class="img-medium img-center" />


- Make sure your NAS and computer are on the **same local network**.
    
- NAS devices detected will appear in a list showing:
    
    - Device name, IP, MAC address, DSM port
        
    - Link to open **DSM (DiskStation Manager)**


:::info NAS Auto-Detection Not Working on VLAN
If you're using a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network), RcloneView may not be able to auto-detect your Synology NAS.  

This is because the auto-discovery feature relies on multicast or broadcast protocols, which are typically restricted or blocked between VLANs for security and traffic isolation reasons.

### Select a Connection Method

  From the dropdown, choose how to connect:

- **WebDAV** (default and recommended)
- **SMB**
- **FTP**
- **SFTP**

**🔗 Need to configure these on Synology first?**

Refer to the official DSM setup guides:

- [Set up WebDAV on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/WebDAVServer/webdav_server)
- [Enable SMB on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/SMBService/smbservice_smb_settings)
- [Set up FTP on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_ftp_setting) 
- [Set up SFTP on Synology](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/help/DSM/AdminCenter/file_ftp_sftp) 

:::important Port Forwarding & DDNS Configuration

If your NAS is behind a router or operating in a NAT (Network Address Translation) environment, you must **configure port forwarding** on your router after enabling WebDAV, SMB, FTP, or SFTP in DSM.

📘 Learn more: [Synology Port Forwarding Guide](https://kb.synology.com/en-global/DSM/tutorial/Quick_Start_External_Access#x_anchor_id5)

Additionally, to access your NAS over the internet using **domain-based access instead of IP address**, you can configure Synology’s **DDNS (Dynamic DNS)** service.

## **🔗 Step 2: Add Synology NAS as a Remote**

After selecting your NAS and connection method, RcloneView will automatically guide you through the **`+ New Remote`** wizard:

- **Provider** is automatically selected based on your chosen connection method (e.g., WebDAV, SMB, SFTP).
- **Remote Name** is auto-filled (e.g., `Synology-28`) — but you can change it if you'd like.
- **URL & Port**:  
  - For **WebDAV**, enter the full URL (e.g., `https://abc.synology.me:5006`)  
  - For **SMB / FTP / SFTP**, enter the **host** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) and appropriate **port**:
    - `445` for SMB  
    - `21` for FTP  
    - `22` for SFTP
- **Username and Password**: Enter the NAS account credentials you use to access shared folders.

- 👉 [How to Add WebDAV Remote](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/webdav)



✅ Once added, your NAS remote will appear in the Remote List.  
You can then open it in the **Explorer** panel to browse files or start transfers.

## **💽 Step 2.5: Mount NAS as a Local Drive (Explorer/Finder)**

Mount any NAS folder as a local drive on Windows (e.g., `W:`) or as a location in macOS Finder. Use the Mount button in the Explorer toolbar.

### How to Mount

1. In RcloneView **Browse/Explorer**, open your NAS remote and navigate to the folder you want to mount.
2. Click the **Mount (<img src="/support/icons/mount-icon.png" alt="mount icon" class="inline-icon" />)** icon on the top toolbar.
3. Configure options:
   - Windows: choose a drive letter (Auto or pick one)
   - macOS: confirm the mount folder name (default like `~/homefolder/<Remote name>`),
4. Click **Save and mount**. The folder appears as a local disk:
   - Windows: under “This PC”, e.g., `synology-28-webdav … (W:)`
   - macOS: under Finder “Locations”

<img src="/support/images/en/tutorials/mount-synology-nas-as-local-drive.png" alt="mount synology nas as local drive" class="img-medium img-center" />
                
:::tip Unmount
To unmount, click **Unmount** in RcloneView or eject the drive from the OS.
:::

:::note Prerequisites
Mounting via `rclone mount` may require an OS filesystem driver. If not installed, follow the links below:
- Windows: [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/)
- macOS: [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/)

For performance, RcloneView enables a **VFS cache** during heavy operations. Initial metadata load may take a moment depending on network conditions.
