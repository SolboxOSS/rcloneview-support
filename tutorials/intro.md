# Google Drive to OneDrive Transfer Guide
  

Cloud storage services have become essential for managing documents, media, and backups. Two of the most widely used services are **Google Drive** and **Microsoft OneDrive**. Each provides generous storage, integration with productivity tools (Google Workspace and Microsoft 365), and wide platform support.

While both platforms provide their own cloud ecosystems, **RcloneView** offers a centralized interface to manage, transfer, and synchronize files between them—**without complex scripts or command-line operations**.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to **transfer files from Google Drive to OneDrive** using **RcloneView**, a GUI-based tool built on top of Rclone that makes multi-cloud file management simple and powerful.
