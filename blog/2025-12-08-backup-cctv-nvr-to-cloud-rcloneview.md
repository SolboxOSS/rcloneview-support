# How to Backup and Archive CCTV/NVR Footage to Cloud Storage Automatically Using RcloneView

> Keep surveillance video safe from theft, fire, or device failure. RcloneView connects NAS/SFTP/SMB NVR folders to Wasabi, S3, or Google Drive, then automates Compare + Sync Jobs so only new footage moves and evidence stays intact.

## 1. Why cloud backup matters for CCTV footage

- NVR/NAS disks fill fast with 24/7 recordings.  
- Theft, fire, or vandalism can wipe the only copy.  
- Compliance and audits demand longer retention windows.  
- Remote review and evidence sharing require off-site access.  
- Manually copying multi-GB H.264/H.265 files is error-prone.

## 2. What makes surveillance files tricky

- Continuous writes create thousands of date-based clips.  
- Large bitrates (1080p/4K) stress bandwidth during backup.  
- Folder trees vary by vendor (YYYY/MM/DD, camera IDs).  
- Need scheduled transfers (hourly/daily) without human oversight.  
- Integrity matters: corrupted frames weaken evidentiary value.

## 3. How RcloneView helps

- Connect **NAS/SMB/SFTP/WebDAV** sources and **Wasabi/S3/Google Drive** targets in one UI.  
- Two-pane Explorer makes cloud-to-cloud or LAN-to-cloud moves visual and direct.  
- **Compare** flags new/changed clips so you only ship deltas.  
- **Checksum** support (S3/Wasabi) validates uploads.  
- **Sync Jobs + scheduling** run backups automatically, no scripts required.

## 4. Step-by-step setup for CCTV/NVR backup

### Step 1) Connect the NVR storage (SMB or SFTP)

1. Click **Remote → + New Remote**.  
2. Choose **SMB** (for NAS/Windows share) or **SFTP** (for Linux NVR exports).  
3. Enter server address, share/path, and credentials (add domain if needed).  
4. Save and confirm listing in Remote Manager.

### Step 2) Add your cloud target (Wasabi/S3/Google Drive)

- **Wasabi/S3**: paste access/secret keys, region, bucket.  
- **Google Drive**: click **Connect** and finish OAuth in the browser.  
- Keep both remotes visible for side-by-side work.

### Step 3) Open source and destination

1. Go to **Browse**.  
2. Left pane: open the NVR folder (e.g., `/recordings/2025/12/08`).  
3. Right pane: open the bucket or Drive folder for backups.  
4. Expand a few date folders to verify paths.

### Step 4) Preview deltas with Compare

- Click **Compare** to highlight missing or size-changed video files.  
- Resolve name collisions (duplicate camera IDs) before copying.  
- This prevents overwriting newer clips on the target.

### Step 5) Copy or Sync safely

- Start with **one-way copy** from NVR → cloud (no deletes).  
- Enable **checksum** for S3/Wasabi to validate uploads.  
- Use **bandwidth limits** during business hours; lift caps overnight.  
- For very large days, lower concurrency to avoid throttling, then raise later.

### Step 6) Save the workflow as a Job

<!-- Image verified: exists -->
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/save-sync-to-jobs.png" alt="Save CCTV sync to jobs" class="img-medium img-center" />

1. In the Sync/Copy dialog, click **Save to Jobs**.  
2. Name it (e.g., `cctv-daily-wasabi`).  
3. Choose one-way sync if you plan to prune old clips later.

### Step 7) Schedule automatic runs

<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-advanced/create-job-schedule.png" alt="Schedule CCTV backup job" class="img-medium img-center" />

- Open **Job Manager → Add Job**.  
- Pick your saved job and set cadence: hourly, every 3 hours, or nightly at 02:00.  
- Stagger jobs by camera group if bandwidth is limited.  
- Check **Job History** after the first few runs.

## 5. Example backup policies

- **Short-term (hot) storage:** keep last 7 days on NAS/NVR for quick review.  
- **Long-term archive:** push all footage to Wasabi/S3 weekly; enable versioning.  
- **Audit/review:** copy selected days to Google Drive for investigators and managers.  
- **Franchise or multi-site:** separate buckets/prefixes per store to isolate access.


## 6. Cost optimization for video archives

- Store rarely accessed footage on **Wasabi** or S3 infrequent-access tiers.  
- Keep only active days on Google Drive for quick sharing.  
- Use lifecycle rules on S3/Wasabi to transition older objects to cheaper tiers.  
- Exclude camera test clips and motionless segments if your policy allows.

## 7. Restore footage when needed

- Browse the cloud remote in Explorer; filter by date folder.  
- Copy only the relevant hour/day to local disk for review.  
- Use **Compare** to confirm restored files match originals (size/time or checksum).  
- For legal holds, duplicate to a separate read-only prefix/bucket.

## 8. Real-world deployment patterns

- **Small retail:** NVR → Wasabi hourly; keep 30 days in cloud, 7 days local.  
- **Factory:** CCTV → NAS → nightly Wasabi copy; monthly S3 cold archive.  
- **Franchise network:** per-location prefixes in one bucket; Drive copies for HQ audits.  
- **Security provider:** per-customer buckets, scheduled jobs, and encrypted remotes for regulated sites. 

## 9. Wrap-up

RcloneView turns CCTV/NVR backups into a predictable, no-CLI workflow. Connect your NAS or recorder via SMB/SFTP, pair it with Wasabi/S3/Google Drive, preview deltas with Compare, and schedule checksum-aware Sync Jobs. With automation, logging, and encryption options, you can meet retention, audit, and disaster-recovery needs without babysitting nightly uploads.
