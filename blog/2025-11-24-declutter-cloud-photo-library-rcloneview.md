# Declutter Cloud Photo Libraries with RcloneView: Compare, Clean, and Protect Every Shot

> Tired of the same RAWs and JPEGs scattered across Google Drive, Dropbox, and a NAS? RcloneView lets you see what's duplicated, clean it up, and lock in protected backups -- all without wrestling CLI flags.

If your photo and video history lives in three or more places, drift is inevitable: duplicates, missing edits, and folders that no one remembers. RcloneView wraps rclone's power in a visual workspace so you can compare sources, mount clouds like local drives, and run repeatable sync jobs that keep a single, protected master library.

## Why a Unified Library Matters

- Stop paying to store the same album twice across providers.
- Keep a single source of truth for Lightroom, Capture One, or Photos.
- Prove backup integrity with logged, checksum-verified runs instead of guesswork.

## Connect Clouds and Mount a Clean Workspace

- Add every location once: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3/Wasabi/R2, or NAS via `+ New Remote`. Guides: [add-oath-online-login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login) and [/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3).

- Mount the key sources so they feel local to your tools: [Mount Cloud Storage as a Local Drive](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive).
- Use consistent paths (e.g., `/Volumes/Photos` or `X:\Photos`) so editors and automations do not break when you switch machines.

## Spot Duplicates and Drift with Compare

- Run **Compare** between any two locations (e.g., Dropbox vs NAS) to see newer, missing, or mismatched files before syncing: [Compare folder contents](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents)
- Filter by extensions to isolate RAWs, JPEGs, or sidecar files when reviewing differences.

## Build a Protected Master Library with Sync Jobs

- Choose your source of truth (often the NAS or the most complete cloud folder) and create a one-way sync to your backup target (e.g., S3/Wasabi with lifecycle policies). Guide: [Create Sync Jobs](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs), and [Execute & Manage Jobs](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job).
- Use job presets for albums or years (e.g., `2020/`, `2021/`) to keep runs small and predictable.
- Prefer **copy** for safety when consolidating; switch to **sync** only after you trust the target and have a history of clean runs.
- Run a dry-run first with the embedded rclone flags to validate includes and excludes.

## Schedule, Monitor, and Verify

- Turn on scheduling so your master library is refreshed nightly instead of whenever someone remembers: [Job Scheduling](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution).

- Use Job History logs as your audit trail; if a run fails, restart from the same job without reconfiguring.  



## Serve Editors and Family Fast

- Keep a fast copy of current projects mounted locally while colder archives stay in S3/Wasabi.
- Create a second job to push lightweight JPEG exports to a sharing cloud (Drive or Dropbox) while RAWs stay in your master vault.
- For travel shoots, mount the cloud on a laptop and let the scheduler backfill to the NAS when you reconnect.
