# Mount SFTP or SMB Storage as Local Drives with RcloneView — Self-Hosted Cloud Integration

> Make your NAS, home server, or office file server behave like Google Drive: mount SFTP or SMB as a real drive letter or `/Volumes` path with caching, buffering, and a GUI.

SFTP and SMB are the backbone of self-hosted storage—Synology/QNAP NAS, home servers, VPSs, and corporate file servers all rely on them. But mounting them reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux often means OS-specific quirks, fragile authentication, no caching controls, and no unified view with your clouds.

RcloneView fixes that. It wraps `rclone mount` into a friendly desktop app so your SFTP/SMB shares act like modern cloud drives—complete with VFS cache, thumbnail streaming, buffering tweaks, and automation.

## Understanding SFTP vs SMB

| Feature    | SFTP                            | SMB                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Protocol   | SSH-based                       | Windows network share                 |
| Best Use   | Remote servers, secure over WAN | LAN file sharing, local network       |
| Speed      | Moderate (encrypted)            | Very fast on LAN                      |
| Security   | Strong by default               | Depends on version/policy             |
| OS Support | Universal                       | Best on Windows/macOS, solid on Linux |

When to pick which?

- **SFTP**: VPS over the internet, zero-trust access, port-forwarded home lab, developers pulling configs.
- **SMB**: Office LAN, high-throughput NAS, shared drives for teams, low-latency media editing inside the network.

RcloneView supports both, alongside Google Drive, S3, Dropbox, OneDrive, and more—managed from the same dashboard.

## Why Use RcloneView for SFTP/SMB Mounting

- **No CLI required**: All `rclone mount` flags are generated in the GUI; see [Remote Manager](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager) for remotes and [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive) for guided mounts.
- **Cross-platform**: Windows (WinFsp), macOS (macFUSE), Linux (FUSE) with consistent UI.
- **True local mounts**: Drive letters on Windows or `/Volumes/Server` on macOS; standard mount points on Linux.
- **Performance ready**: VFS cache, thumbnail streaming, buffering controls, and read-ahead tuning surfaced in the Mount dialog.
- **Unified control**: Manage SFTP/SMB alongside cloud storage, schedule remounts, and monitor throughput in one place (see [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution) and [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring)).

## Step-by-Step — Mount SFTP or SMB with RcloneView

### 1) Add Remote (SFTP or SMB)

- Open **Remote Manager** → **Add Remote** → choose **SFTP** or **SMB**.
- Enter **Host/IP** and **Port**.
- Authenticate with **Username/Password** or **SSH Key** for SFTP. For SMB, set domain/user if required.
- Save the remote; consider enabling a config password in [General Settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings).

### 2) Create a Mount Job

- In **Mount Manager** or the Explorer toolbar, click **Mount**.
- Select your SFTP/SMB remote and pick the target:
  - Windows → `X:` (or any free drive letter)
  - macOS → `/Volumes/ServerName`
  - Linux → `/mnt/server` or your preferred path

### 3) Configure VFS Cache & Buffers

- **Cache mode**: `Full` for smooth browsing and thumbnail streaming (ideal for photos/Plex).
- **Cache directory**: Point to an SSD folder.
- **Read-ahead**: 4–8 MB for media scrubbing; increase for 4K video.
- **Write-back/Buffering**: Enable for large sequential writes; cap bandwidth if you share links.

### 4) Mount and Test

- Click **Mount** and open Finder/Explorer/Files.
- Browse folders; preview images and stream videos to verify caching.
- Keep the Mount entry saved so it auto-reconnects after reboot (toggle **Auto Mount**).

## Use Cases

- **NAS remote access**: Treat your NAS like a cloud drive from any OS.
- **Local ↔ cloud ↔ self-hosted**: Move files between SFTP/SMB and Google Drive/S3/Dropbox in one UI.
- **Office shared drive integration**: Map departmental shares with cached thumbnails for design teams.
- **Media editing**: Edit video/photos directly from NAS with VFS caching to avoid re-downloads.
- **Multi-server hub**: Mount multiple SFTP/SMB servers side by side and drag-drop between them.

## Performance Tips

- Set **Cache mode: Full** for media-heavy workloads (Plex/Photos).
- Use an **NVMe/SSD cache directory** to accelerate thumbnails and scrubbing.
- Increase **Read-ahead** and **buffer-size** for large sequential reads/writes.
- Prefer **LAN** for SMB when throughput matters; for SFTP over WAN, use SSH keys for stability.
- Monitor transfers in [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring) and schedule remounts via [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution).

## Conclusion — Self-Hosted Meets Multi-Cloud

SFTP and SMB no longer need to feel like legacy network drives. With RcloneView you get cloud-like mounts, smart caching, and a unified dashboard that mixes NAS, VPS, and public clouds without scripts. Add your server once, choose a drive letter or `/Volumes` path, and let RcloneView keep the mount alive while you focus on your files.
