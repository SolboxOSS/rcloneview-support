# Map Azure Blob Storage as a Local Drive on Windows & macOS with RcloneView

> Replace scripts and Storage Explorer with a two-click mount: RcloneView turns Azure Blob containers into true local drives with caching, buffering, and auto-remount across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Azure Blob is fantastic for offloading media, backups, and static assets—but mounting it as a fast, reliable drive is tricky. `rclone mount` flags, WinFsp/macFUSE installs, shared access signatures (SAS), and reconnect scripts get complicated fast.

RcloneView wraps everything in a GUI: add your Azure remote once, pick a drive letter or `/Volumes` path, turn on VFS cache for thumbnails and media scrubbing, and let Scheduler remount it on login. No CLI required.

## Why Mount Azure Blob with RcloneView Instead of Scripts

- **Zero CLI**: Remote Manager builds your Azure remote and stores credentials securely (see [Remote Manager](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager)).
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Windows (WinFsp), macOS (macFUSE), Linux (FUSE) with the same UI.
- **Real drive mapping**: Drive letters on Windows or `/Volumes/Azure` on macOS for any container.
- **Performance built in**: VFS cache, thumbnail streaming, read-ahead, and buffering surfaced in the Mount dialog (see [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive)).
- **Automation & monitoring**: Auto-mount on startup, reconnect on failure, and live throughput charts (see [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution) and [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring)).

## Step-by-Step — Map Azure Blob as a Local Drive

### 1) Prepare Azure credentials

- Create a Storage Account and a Blob container.
- Generate either **Access Key** or **SAS token** (least privilege recommended for production).
- Note the **Account Name** and **Container** you want to mount.

### 2) Add the Azure remote

- Open **Remote Manager** → **Add Remote** → choose **S3-compatible** (works with Azure Blob’s S3 gateway) or **WebDAV** if using that endpoint.
- For **S3-compatible**:
  - **Provider**: Custom / S3-compatible
  - **Endpoint**: `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net`
  - **Region**: leave blank or `us-east-1` placeholder
  - **Access Key / Secret**: your Azure key or SAS-derived pair
- Save the remote. Use a strong **Config Password** in [General Settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings).

### 3) Create a Mount job

- In **Mount Manager** (or the Explorer toolbar), click **Mount**.
- Select your Azure remote and specify the container path (e.g., `azure:media-assets`).
- Choose the mount target:
  - Windows → `Z:` (or any free letter)
  - macOS → `/Volumes/AzureMedia`
  - Linux → `/mnt/azure-media`

### 4) Tune VFS cache and buffers

- **Cache mode**: `Full` for thumbnails, previews, and media scrubbing.
- **Cache directory**: Point to an SSD folder.
- **Read-ahead**: 4–8 MB for photo/video browsing; increase for 4K+ workloads.
- **Write-back/Buffering**: Enable for large sequential uploads; cap bandwidth if sharing uplink with others.

### 5) Mount and verify

- Click **Mount**. Open Explorer/Finder/Files and browse the container as a local drive.
- Confirm thumbnails load quickly; stream a sample video to validate buffering.
- Toggle **Auto Mount on startup** so RcloneView reconnects after reboot.

## Use Cases

- **Design & media teams**: Keep large asset libraries in Blob while editing locally with cached reads.
- **Dev/Test environments**: Mount build artifacts or static sites for quick iteration.
- **Data collection**: Drop IoT or log exports straight into Blob without browser uploads.
- **Hybrid cloud workflows**: Drag-drop between Azure, S3, Google Drive, and NAS from one dashboard.
- **Backup staging**: Mount Blob as cheap warm storage before archiving to Glacier/R2.

## Performance Tips

- Set **Cache mode: Full** for heavy media/photo libraries.
- Use an **NVMe/SSD cache directory**; keep several GB free.
- Increase **Read-ahead** and **buffer-size** for sequential reads/writes; lower for random small files.
- For distributed teams, pair mounts with **Scheduler** to refresh or warm the cache daily.
- Watch throughput in [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring) to spot throttling.

## Troubleshooting

- **403 or auth errors**: Reissue SAS/keys and confirm the endpoint `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net`.
- **Slow listings**: Raise VFS cache size and read-ahead; ensure cache path is on SSD.
- **Mount disappears after sleep**: Enable Auto Mount plus Scheduler’s “Restart failed jobs” option.
- **macOS permissions**: Approve macFUSE prompts; then remount via Mount Manager.

## Conclusion — Azure Blob as a First-Class Drive

With RcloneView, Azure Blob feels like a native drive: mapped letters or `/Volumes`, smart caching, and automation—all without CLI scripts. Add your container once, tune VFS for your workload, and keep your self-hosted and multi-cloud storage in one control panel.
