# Photographer’s Guide: Deliver Galleries to Any Client Cloud with RcloneView

> Stage your finals once, then fan them out to whatever storage each client demands: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive/SharePoint, Box, or S3/Wasabi/R2. RcloneView gives you a two-pane GUI over rclone with Compare, Jobs, and cloud-to-cloud speed so you stop re-uploading the same gallery all night.

## Why photographers need this

- Clients often require uploads into their own storage (policy, retention) instead of a public link.  
- Different destinations per job: agency wants Drive, brand wants Dropbox file request, retoucher sits on OneDrive, archive is Wasabi/S3.  
- Re-uploading 8-12 GB per client crushes home upstream; vendor apps give opaque errors.  
- Need partial updates: send only changed selects without re-exporting or re-uploading everything.  
- Sometimes you stage on a cloud VM for speed; browser logins there are awkward.

RcloneView covers 100+ providers in one UI and can shift heavy transfers to a cloud-hosted rclone when your uplink is the bottleneck.

## Quick setup (10 minutes)

1. Install RcloneView (Win/macOS/Linux): https://rcloneview.com/src/download.html  
2. Add the remotes your clients use via **Remote -> + New Remote**:  
   - Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive/SharePoint, Box (OAuth).  
   - S3/Wasabi/R2/B2 (S3-compatible: endpoint + keys).  
   - WebDAV/SFTP for custom endpoints.  
3. Optional: run **external rclone** on a cloud VM for cloud-to-cloud speed. Guide: https://rcloneview.com/support/tutorials/new-window-with-external-rclone (pattern works for any pair).

## Delivery flow: stage once, deliver everywhere

1. Stage finals in `Projects/Client/Finals` (local SSD or NAS).  
2. Open two panes: left = Finals, right = target cloud.  
3. Click **Compare** to see what is missing; then **Copy ->** to send only new/changed files.  
4. Switch the right tab to the next client cloud; reuse the same source-no second local upload.  
5. Save each flow as a **Job** for repeat clients; run or schedule.

## Handling common photographer asks

- Agency wants Drive + Wasabi: Copy to Drive, flip the tab to Wasabi, Copy again-no second local upload.  
- Brand sends a Dropbox request link and the retoucher uses Box: keep both remotes open, drag to each without re-exporting or re-uploading.  
- Client swaps 10 selects after sign-off: run Compare or Sync with **Dry Run**; only changed files move.  
- Client forbids public links: deliver inside their tenant (Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox/Wasabi) without generating external shares.  
- Shared workstation: enable app lock (tutorials/enable-app-lock.md) so stored credentials are protected.

## Cloud-to-cloud when your uplink is weak

- Start `rclone rcd` on a cloud VM (EC2/GCE), open a **New Window** in RcloneView, connect to that daemon, add remotes there, and run Compare/Copy.  
- External rclone pattern (OneDrive -> Wasabi example): [cloud-to-cloud example](https://rcloneview.com/support/tutorials/external-rclone-onedrive-sharepoint-to-wasabi)
- Headless auth guides: [OneDrive headless](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/ec2-onedrive-headless) and [Google Drive headless](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/ec2-google-drive-connection)

## Mini playbook (busy week)

1) Remotes: Drive (agency), Dropbox (brand), OneDrive (retoucher), Wasabi (archive).  
2) Tabs: Left = Finals; Right = one tab per remote.  
3) Automate: Save each as a Job; schedule weekly refresh for ongoing campaigns.  
4) Verify: Check Job History/logs; send links with confidence.

## Why not just send a public link?

- If the client only wants a public link, you are done.  
- Use RcloneView when clients need assets inside their own storage (policy/retention), or when you must deliver to multiple destinations without re-uploading, with partial updates, logging, and cloud-to-cloud speed.

## Summary

Photographers do not need three vendor apps to satisfy three clouds. With RcloneView you stage once, Compare, Copy, and schedule Jobs across Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive/SharePoint, Box, and S3/Wasabi. Clear logs, retries, and optional cloud-to-cloud offload mean fewer late nights and faster handoffs.
