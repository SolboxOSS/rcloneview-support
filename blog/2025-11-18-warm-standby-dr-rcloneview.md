# Warm-Standby Disaster Recovery Across Clouds with RcloneView (S3, Wasabi, R2, OneDrive)

> Keep a live copy of production data in another region or cloud and switch within minutes when incidents strike.

Warm-standby DR pairs a primary location (e.g., AWS S3 or OneDrive) with a continuously updated standby (e.g., Cloudflare R2 or Wasabi). RcloneView layers a GUI over rclone so you can schedule steady syncs, validate drift with Compare, and mount the standby for rapid failover—without shell scripts.

## Why warm-standby with RcloneView

- Faster recovery: Standby copies are within minutes/hours of primary, not days.
- Cloud choice: Mix S3, Wasabi, R2, B2, Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.
- No scripts: Build jobs in a wizard, not YAML/cron.
- Visible drift: Compare highlights mismatches before you need to fail over.
- Safer restores: Mount the standby and copy back without touching production.

## Strategy and architecture

```
[Primary cloud/local/NAS] --(RcloneView scheduled Sync)--> [Standby cloud/region]
                                                \
                                                 --(Weekly Compare)--> [Drift report]
```

- Primary: where apps write (S3 bucket, OneDrive site, GDrive workspace, NAS).
- Standby: another region/provider with versioning (R2/Wasabi/S3/B2).
- Control: RcloneView runs sync on intervals; Compare checks integrity; Mount enables rapid access during failover.

## Prerequisites

- Two remotes configured in RcloneView (e.g., `s3:prod-bucket` and `r2:standby-bucket`).
- Versioning enabled on the standby for rollback safety.
- IAM/API permissions for list/read/write on both sides.
- Bandwidth window for scheduled replication (nightly or hourly).

## Step 1: Build the baseline sync job

1. Create a Sync job: Source = primary, Destination = standby.
2. Use one-way Sync to mirror new/updated files; keep deletes if you want strict parity.
3. Add filters for noisy paths (e.g., cache/temp) in the Filtering step.
4. In **Advanced Settings**, adjust transfer counts and enable checksum comparison if both sides support hashes.
5. Save the job so the same settings apply to every run (Job Manager).

## Step 2: Schedule continuous updates

1. In the Job wizard (Step 4: Scheduling, Plus license), enable scheduling for the DR job.
2. Choose cadence: hourly for app data, nightly for archives, and use **Simulate** to preview upcoming runs.
3. Set retry attempts in Advanced Settings for flaky links.
4. Keep a manual weekly Compare to detect drift early.

## Step 3: Verify and monitor

- Use Compare to ensure object counts align before declaring the standby ready.
- Review Job History for failures or retries and rerun the job if a window was missed.
- Keep versioning on the standby so accidental deletes can be recovered.

## Step 4: Failover playbook

1. Mount the standby: use Mount Manager to mount the destination remote to a stable path/drive letter.
2. Point workloads to the mounted path or to the standby bucket endpoint.
3. Keep the primary in read-only or offline until incident triage is done.


## Tuning tips

- Latency-sensitive apps: lower transfer counts in Advanced Settings and schedule during low traffic.
- Compliance: keep versioning on the standby and export Job History for audits.
- Cost control: exclude staging/temp folders via Filters and apply lifecycle policies on the standby cloud.
- Multi-cloud: run separate jobs if you need two standbys (e.g., R2 + Wasabi) from the same primary.

## Troubleshooting checklist

- Mismatched counts: rerun Compare and review Job History for skipped items; confirm versioning is on.
- Permission errors: ensure API keys allow list/read/write on both clouds.
- Restore deletes data: use Copy (not Sync) when bringing data back to production.


Keep your standby warm, tested, and ready so failover is a switch—not a scramble.
