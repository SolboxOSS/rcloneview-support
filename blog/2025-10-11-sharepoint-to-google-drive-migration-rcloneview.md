# Master SharePoint to Google Drive Migration with RcloneView: A Step-by-Step Business Guide

> Move SharePoint document libraries to Google Drive (Workspace) with a visual, throttled, and repeatable flow that corporate admins can run without touching the CLI.

RcloneView wraps rclone’s SharePoint and Google Drive connectors into a GUI with audit-friendly logs, scheduler, and real-time monitoring. This guide shows how to plan and execute a staged migration so you can move team sites, project folders, or whole business units without downtime.

## Why use RcloneView for SharePoint → Google Drive

- No CLI required: configure Microsoft 365 (SharePoint/OneDrive for Business) and Google Drive remotes through guided dialogs.
- Business-friendly: throttle requests to avoid SharePoint and Drive API rate limits, and schedule cutovers during maintenance windows.
- Operational visibility: side-by-side explorer, compare & copy, job history, and live transfer monitoring for audits.
- Flexible moves: single copy, bidirectional sync, or staged delta syncs that keep source and destination aligned.

## Prerequisites (enterprise-ready)

- RcloneView installed and signed in with accounts that have access to the target SharePoint site and Google Drive destination (Shared Drive or My Drive).
- Admin consent granted for Microsoft Graph if your tenant restricts third-party apps.
- A cutover window (or allow staged syncs) and enough Drive/Shared Drive quota.

## Step 1 — Connect SharePoint and Google Drive remotes

1) In **RcloneView ? Settings ? Remote Storage**, add a new remote.

2) Choose **OneDrive/SharePoint (Microsoft 365)**, sign in with the account that owns or can access the site, and pick the correct **Site / Document Library** (e.g., `/sites/Marketing/Shared Documents`).  
3) Add **Google Drive** (Workspace): choose whether to land in **My Drive** or a specific **Shared Drive** for the project.  
4) Test each remote and save.

## Step 2 — Map the right libraries and target folders

- For each SharePoint library, note the path you selected in the connection dialog; open it in Explorer to confirm the root (you should see the expected department folders).
- Create the matching folder structure in Google Drive/Shared Drive if it does not already exist.
- If you have per-team isolation, repeat with multiple SharePoint remotes (one per site or per sensitive collection).

## Step 3 — Validate with a side-by-side check

- Open both remotes in the two-pane Explorer.

- Use **Compare** to preview differences (size, missing files) before copying.

- Copy a small pilot folder first to verify permissions, versioned files, and naming rules (SharePoint’s `# % & { }` become valid on Drive, but long paths may still need cleanup).

## Step 4 — Choose your migration mode

- **One-time copy (fastest)**: Use **Copy** for lift-and-shift into the new Shared Drive. Ideal when the source goes read-only during cutover.
- **Sync (two-way optional)**: Use **Sync** when users still edit files during migration; finish with a final delta sync in the cutover window.
- **Server-side when possible**: If your SharePoint and Drive are internet-reachable, RcloneView leverages server-side copies where supported to reduce egress.

Drag-and-drop also works for ad-hoc moves and quick fixes.

## Step 5 — Create a repeatable job and schedule the cutover

1) In **Jobs**, create a new **Copy** or **Sync** job from the SharePoint library to the target Shared Drive path.  
2) Set **Bandwidth limits** and **Transfers** to respect Microsoft 365 and Google Drive throttling (e.g., `tpslimit`, `--drive-chunk-size`, or **Max Transfer** sliders).  
3) Save, then schedule during off-hours for the bulk move; add a second schedule for deltas.

## Step 6 — Run, monitor, and handle throttling

- Start the job and watch progress in real time (throughput, ETA, errors).  
<img src="/support/images/en/tutorials/wasabi-real-time-monitoring-transferring.png" alt="transfer monitoring" class="img-large img-center" />
- If you see `throttled` or `403`/`429` responses, lower transfers or add a short backoff; RcloneView surfaces these logs without opening a terminal.
- Use **Job History** to export results for compliance and retry any failed objects directly from the UI.

## Step 7 — Post-migration checks and handoff

- Re-run **Compare** to confirm the destination matches SharePoint before unlocking user access.
- Spot-check permissions: while Drive ACLs do not mirror SharePoint automatically, you can bulk-share the new root with the right Workspace groups.
- Keep the job as a scheduled delta sync for a few days if teams remain active on SharePoint, then switch the source to read-only.

## Troubleshooting tips for corporate environments

- **Complex sites**: Connect per site/library instead of tenant-wide to avoid accidental scope creep.
- **Long paths or odd characters**: Enable Rclone’s Unicode normalization and path length handling in advanced options; rename edge cases in Explorer before the cutover.
- **Data sovereignty**: For regulated teams, target regional Shared Drives and keep an audit of job history exports.

## Wrap-up

RcloneView gives IT teams a visual, low-risk path to migrate SharePoint libraries into Google Drive or Shared Drives. With policy-friendly throttling, scheduled cutovers, and live monitoring, you can move business-critical data without command-line scripts, keep stakeholders informed, and leave a repeatable job in place for future consolidations.
