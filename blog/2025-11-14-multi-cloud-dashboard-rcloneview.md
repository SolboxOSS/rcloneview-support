# Sync Multiple Clouds in One Dashboard — RcloneView for Multi-Cloud Management

> One pane, all your clouds. RcloneView turns multi-account chaos into a single dashboard for browsing, syncing, comparing, and scheduling jobs.

Most of us juggle at least two clouds. Personal Google Drive, work OneDrive, a shared Dropbox, maybe S3/Wasabi/R2 for archives. Each has different UIs, quotas, and quirks. Moving folders between them usually means manual downloads, re-uploads, or juggling multiple browser tabs. RcloneView fixes that by layering a modern GUI over rclone’s 70+ backends so every account feels like part of one workspace.

## Understanding Multi-Cloud Management

**Multi-cloud management** means viewing and controlling all your storage providers from one interface—organizing files, running transfers, and automating policies without logging into each platform separately.

Why it matters:

- Save time: drag across clouds in seconds instead of downloading/uploading manually.
- Automate backups: keep Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, and S3 in sync on a schedule.
- See the whole picture: compare folder states, dedupe archives, and avoid accidental sprawl.
- Control costs: move cold data to cheaper S3/Wasabi tiers with a single job.

| Challenge without a tool                               | Difficulty                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Accounts scattered across Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, S3 | Need separate logins and apps                         |
| Moving data cross-cloud                                | Requires local download/re-upload; slow & error-prone |
| Comparing folder contents                              | Each service has different UIs & no side-by-side diff |
| Lack of automation                                     | Manual backups risk being skipped                     |

RcloneView solves these with a unified explorer, drag-and-drop transfers, job scheduling, and power-user options (filters, versioned backups, mount, VFS cache). For a deeper dive on multi-account basics, see /blog/2025-10-27-manage-multiple-cloud-accounts-with-rcloneview.

## Why RcloneView Is the Right Multi-Cloud Dashboard

1. **Connect every cloud once**  
   Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, S3/Wasabi/R2, pCloud, Mega, Box, WebDAV, FTP/SFTP, NAS shares, local disks—RcloneView treats them uniformly inside the Explorer.

2. **Cloud-to-cloud transfers without local hops**  
   Copy Drive ➜ S3 or OneDrive ➜ Dropbox directly. Bandwidth runs between cloud endpoints via rclone.

3. **Auto-sync & backup scheduler**  
   Save Sync/Copy/Move jobs and schedule them daily/hourly; RcloneView keeps the automation running.

4. **Compare before you copy**  
   Side-by-side diffs show which folders differ so you can clean duplicates or verify migrations.

5. **Advanced rclone power minus CLI**  
   Filters, include/exclude rules, versioned backups (`--backup-dir`), mount with VFS cache, retries/logging—all wired into the GUI.

## Step-by-Step — Manage Multiple Clouds in RcloneView

### Step 1 — Add your remotes

Click **`+ New Remote`** for each provider. Use OAuth wizards for Google/Dropbox/OneDrive, or supply keys/endpoints for S3-compatible services. All remotes appear under the Explorer and Remote Manager.  
See: https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login and https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3

### Step 2 — Browse clouds side-by-side

Open two remotes simultaneously—Drive on the left, S3 on the right. Drill down via the tree, rename folders, delete, or open local/external paths the same way.

### Step 3 — Transfer across clouds

Drag and drop from one pane to another, or use Copy/Move operations. For precise control, open the Sync dialog and select Copy/Sync/Move with optional dry-runs.  
See: https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages

### Step 4 — Schedule automatic jobs

Save the sync as a Job and enable scheduling (daily at 1 AM, hourly, weekdays-only). Perfect for Drive ➜ Wasabi nightly backups or Dropbox ➜ OneDrive consolidation.

### Step 5 — Compare clouds, remove duplicates

Launch **Compare** to spot differences between two folders. Filter by “Only in A/B” or “Changed” to clean up duplicates or confirm migrations before you pull the trigger.

## Advanced Features for Power Users

- **Versioned backups**: Copy changes into date-stamped folders or `backup-dir` locations for rollbacks.
- **Filters**: Include/exclude patterns to skip cache folders, ISO files, or sensitive data.
- **Mount**: Map any cloud to a drive letter/path with VFS cache for desktop apps. See https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive.
- **Scheduler + notifications**: Get desktop alerts on completion or review job history logs.
- **S3 tuning**: Adjust threads, chunk size, or storage class to match cost/performance goals.
