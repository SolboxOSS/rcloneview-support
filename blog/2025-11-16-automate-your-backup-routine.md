# Automate Your Backup Routine: Schedule Daily Sync Jobs Across Clouds

> Turn nightly backups into a set-and-forget workflow with RcloneView’s scheduler and visual job controls.

## Why automated cloud backup converts

“Automated cloud backup” is one of the highest-intent search terms for storage tools. Teams want:

- **Predictable recovery points** without manual starts.  
- **Multi-cloud safety**—copy data to S3, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, or B2.  
- **Auditable history** to prove compliance.  
- **GUI-first control** so ops and non-CLI teammates can manage schedules.

RcloneView rides on the rclone engine but wraps it with Jobs, Compare, and scheduling so you can automate backups visually.

## Reference setup

1. **Sources:** NAS shares, on-prem file servers, Google Drive/OneDrive/Dropbox.  
2. **Targets:** Amazon S3/Glacier, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, or another S3-compatible.  
3. **Network:** Ensure outbound HTTPS and stable bandwidth during your backup window.  
4. **Permissions:** Create least-privilege API users for each destination bucket.

## Step 1 – Add remotes in RcloneView

1. Open **RcloneView** → **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Choose the backend type (S3, R2, B2, Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, WebDAV/SMB for NAS).  
3. Name them clearly (`NAS_Main`, `S3_Backup`, `R2_Secondary`).  
4. Confirm connectivity in the Explorer pane.

## Step 2 – Create a daily backup job

1. On the main screen, go to **Home → Job Manager → Add Job**.  
2. Pick your **source and destination**, then choose **Sync** to keep a mirrored copy.  
3. Run a **Dry Run** to preview what will change before the first real execution.  
4. Save the job with a descriptive name: `[Daily] NAS→S3 Backup`.

> Tip: If you need versioned backups, set `--backup-dir` to a dated prefix (e.g., `/backups/{date}`) so older files stay preserved.

## Step 3 – Schedule and throttle

1. Open the job → **Scheduling**. Select **Minute, Hour, Day of Week, Day of Month, and Month** to set your cadence.  
2. Click **Simulate** to preview the next run times and confirm the pattern.  
3. Adjust **bandwidth limits** for business hours, then remove caps overnight.  
4. Configure **notifications** (email/Slack) for success, warnings, or failures.  
5. Set **retry** and **backoff** options for unreliable links.

## Step 4 – Monitor and audit

- **Job History:** Track duration, throughput, and errors.  
- **Compare:** Run periodic compares to confirm parity between source and backup.  
- **Logs:** Export logs weekly for compliance (RPO/RTO evidence).  
- **Health checks:** Quarterly restore tests to a staging bucket or NAS.

## Pro tips for rock-solid schedules

- Stagger multiple jobs to avoid API throttling (e.g., `[Daily] NAS→S3` at 1am, `[Daily] S3→R2` at 3am).  
- Use **`--checksum`** for critical archives; prefer **`--size-only`** for speed-sensitive runs.  
- Keep **`--max-age`** or include/exclude filters to limit noisy directories.  
- Clone a proven job as a template for new teams or regions—settings stay consistent.  
- Label jobs by tier: `[Primary Backup]`, `[Offsite Copy]`, `[Archive Glacier]`.

## FAQs

**Q. Does scheduling require the app to stay open?**  
**A.** RcloneView’s background service runs jobs; keep it active or deploy on a small VM/NAS that stays online.

**Q. Can I automate multi-hop backups (e.g., NAS→S3→R2)?**  
**A.** Yes. Chain two jobs with different schedules and ensure the second starts after the first window.

**Q. What about deletion safety?**  
**A.** Start with `--backup-dir` or `--max-delete` thresholds until you’re confident in the sync pattern.

**Q. How do I prove backups happened?**  
**A.** Export Job History weekly and archive it with your compliance reports.
