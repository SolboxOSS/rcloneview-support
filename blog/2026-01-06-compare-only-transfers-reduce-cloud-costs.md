# Reduce Cloud Storage Costs with Compare-Only Transfers in RcloneView

> Cloud storage looks cheap until API calls and repeated syncs inflate the bill. Compare-first workflows cut unnecessary traffic while keeping migrations safe.

Most cost surprises are not caused by storage itself. They come from **blind sync behavior**: full scans, repeated metadata checks, and transfers that move nothing new. The fix is simple: **Compare first, transfer only when changes exist**.

## Cloud storage is cheap - until it isn't

Storage is only one part of your bill. Real costs include:

- API request volume
- Repeated metadata scans
- Egress/ingress traffic
- High-frequency sync jobs

In multi-cloud environments, these costs scale quickly. The more accounts and regions you sync, the more expensive “just sync everything” becomes.

## The real problem: blind transfers

Blind sync means you launch a sync without knowing:

- What changed
- How many files will move
- How much data will transfer

That creates unpredictable bills and unnecessary traffic. Compare-first turns sync into a controlled decision.

## What is Compare-only transfer?

Compare is not just a safety tool. It is a **cost-control tool**.

### What Compare does

- Compares source and destination folders
- Identifies only changed files
- Produces a transfer candidate list

If Compare finds **no changes**, you transfer **nothing**.

## Why Compare-first cuts cloud costs

### 1) Fewer API calls

Compare skips unnecessary transfers and reduces repeated scans.

### 2) Less data transfer

Only changed files move. Duplicate uploads vanish.

### 3) Predictable billing

Compare results show what will change before you pay for it.

## Compare-only vs traditional sync

**Traditional workflow**
1) Sync runs  
2) Full scan  
3) Some changes found  
4) Transfers + cost

**Compare-first workflow**
1) Compare runs  
2) No changes → stop  
3) Changes found → copy or sync only what matters  

## Practical cost-saving workflows in RcloneView

### Workflow 1: Compare → Copy only changed files

Use Compare, then Copy only the changed items. This avoids delete risk and limits traffic.

### Workflow 2: Compare → Conditional Sync

Only Sync when Compare results meet a threshold (e.g., 100+ changes).

</div>

### Workflow 3: Compare + scheduled jobs

Run Compare daily, but perform full Sync weekly. This keeps data aligned without daily transfer costs.

</div>

## Why RcloneView makes Compare-first practical

- **Visual cost awareness**: see exactly what will change.  
- **Filtering = cost control**: exclude cache/log files or specific extensions.  
- **No CLI flags to forget**: UI reduces error-prone options.

## Best practices to reduce cloud sync bills

- Make **Compare** the default, not Sync.  
- Combine Compare with **Dry Run** for extra assurance.  
- Avoid full Sync on a schedule when changes are small.

## Common misconceptions

**“Compare also costs money.”**  
Yes, but far less than full Sync and transfer costs.

**“Sync is faster.”**  
Maybe in the short term. Over time, it is usually the most expensive choice.

## What savings look like in real workflows

- API calls: often reduced by 60–90%  
- Data transfer: commonly reduced by 70% or more  
- Monthly bills: become more stable and predictable

The larger your dataset and the more automation you run, the bigger the savings.

## Conclusion: stop paying for invisible transfers

Cloud cost control is not about cheaper storage. It is about **smarter workflows**.

Compare first. Transfer only what changed. Sync last.

RcloneView’s Compare-first workflow is not just safer — it is the most cost-efficient way to run cloud migrations at scale.
