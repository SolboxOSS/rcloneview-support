## Getting ready

Before you start:

- **Organize the source**: group content (e.g., `Photos/`, `Projects/`, `Docs/`) for cleaner jobs  
- **Check Proton Drive capacity**: ensure enough space for your initial upload and future growth  
- **Decide the approach**: one-time upload, staged batches, or continuous sync with a schedule  
- **Optionally add encryption layers**: advanced users can stack rclone **crypt** for extra control

## Connect Proton Drive in RcloneView

RcloneView wraps rclone‚Äôs configuration in a guided, click-through flow.

1. Open **RcloneView** and click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Select **Proton Drive** and follow the sign-in/token prompts (per the guide), then name it (e.g., `MyProton`)  
3. On the other side, add a **Local** remote (your hard drive path, like `D:\Media` or `/Users/you/Archive`)  
4. Confirm both appear side-by-side in the Explorer pane

## Transfer & sync options

### Drag & Drop
Visually copy files/folders from the **Local** panel into **Proton Drive**‚Äîideal for one-off moves or quick wins.  

üëâ See more: [Copying Files using Drag and Drop](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage#copying-files-using-drag-and-drop)

### Compare & Copy
Run **Compare** to preview differences (new, changed, missing) before you copy‚Äîperfect for selective updates and avoiding duplicates.  

üëâ See more: [Compare and Manage Files](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents#compare-results-and-manage-files)

### Sync & Scheduled jobs
Mirror chosen local folders into Proton Drive on a schedule‚Äînightly, weekly, or custom. Always **dry-run** first to validate planned actions, then save as a reusable **Job**.

**Pro tips**  
- Start with a **pilot folder** to validate speed, structure, and filters  
- Use filters to exclude caches, temp files, and renders you don‚Äôt need in the cloud  
- Keep the source read-only during large initial uploads to minimize drift

## Conclusion ‚Äî key takeaways & extra tips

- **Why**: off-site resilience plus privacy-first storage for your most important files  
- **How**: RcloneView lets you connect **Local** and **Proton Drive**, then **Drag & Drop**, **Compare**, or **Sync**‚Äîwith **scheduling** for hands-off protection  
- **Scale safely**: upload in batches, monitor jobs, and review logs to keep a clean audit trail
