# Backblaze B2 vs Dropbox — Pick the Right Fit (and Move Seamlessly with RcloneView)

> Compare an **object storage** workhorse with a **collaboration-first** drive—and learn how to move files between them with a clean, point-and-click workflow.

## Why compare Backblaze B2 and Dropbox?

Cloud storage isn’t one-size-fits-all. **Backblaze B2** shines as affordable, S3-compatible **object storage** for backups and archives, while **Dropbox** excels at **desktop-style sync, sharing, and collaboration**. Many teams mix both: B2 for durable, low-cost storage and Dropbox for day-to-day work and external sharing. RcloneView brings these worlds together so you can **preview, copy, and sync** between them without touching the CLI.
