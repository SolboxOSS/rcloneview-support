# How to Encrypt Cloud Backups: Secure Google Drive, OneDrive, and S3 with RcloneView

> Encrypt before you upload. Keep your cloud backups private with RcloneView’s simple GUI over rclone crypt—no command line required.

Whether you’re a home user backing up photos, an engineer syncing project archives, or an IT admin protecting business data, one rule never goes out of style: encrypt sensitive files before they hit the cloud. Cloud providers secure data at rest, but they typically hold the keys and can see filenames and metadata. Client‑side encryption flips that model—only you control the keys, and the provider stores ciphertext.

<!-- truncate -->

With RcloneView, you get a modern, visual interface for rclone’s battle‑tested crypt backend. You can wrap any storage—Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Wasabi, R2, and more—with client‑side encryption, then copy, compare, and schedule sync jobs like you already do.

## Why encrypt cloud backups in 2025?

- Privacy by default: Providers may see filenames, folder names, and sizes. Client‑side encryption keeps both content and names private.
- Shared PCs and SaaS sprawl: Backups often move between laptops, cloud buckets, and departmental drives. Encryption prevents accidental exposure.
- Compliance and risk management: Meet policies for PII, source code, or legal docs without changing where you store data.
- Zero‑trust posture: Assume every system can be breached and minimize what plaintext exists anywhere.

### Understanding the models

- Server‑side encryption (SSE): Provider encrypts objects on disk but usually manages keys (e.g., Google default at rest, OneDrive at rest, S3 SSE‑S3/KMS). Simple, but filenames and access patterns remain visible, and providers can decrypt.
- Client‑side encryption (CSE) with rclone crypt: Data and (optionally) filenames are encrypted before upload. Only your passphrase can decrypt. Portable across clouds.

### What does rclone crypt protect?

- File contents: AES‑GCM or equivalent, authenticated.
- Filenames: Optional; obscures names and directory structure.
- Integrity: Authenticated encryption detects tampering.

### Quick comparison

| Approach                                   | Who holds keys | Hides filenames | Portability |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Provider default (Google/OneDrive at rest) | Provider       | No              | N/A         |
| S3 SSE‑S3                                  | AWS            | No              | S3 only     |
| S3 SSE‑KMS                                 | You/AWS KMS    | No              | S3 only     |
| rclone crypt (via RcloneView)              | You            | Yes (optional)  | Any backend |

## Why transfer encrypted data between storages?

Many teams keep a primary cloud and a secondary “cold” copy. RcloneView lets you encrypt once and store the same ciphertext everywhere.

- Multi‑cloud redundancy: Keep encrypted backups in Google Drive and S3/Wasabi.
- Policy separation: Collaboration on OneDrive; encrypted archives in S3 with lifecycle rules.
- Cost control: Migrate encrypted archives to cheaper tiers without re‑encrypting.

RcloneView adds guardrails to rclone:

- Visual Explorer for drag‑and‑drop copies
- Compare preview to see differences before you sync
- Saved Sync jobs with scheduling and history

## Step 1 – Preparation

1. Choose targets: Decide which storages will hold encrypted data (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, S3/Wasabi/R2 buckets).
2. Plan layout: Pick an encrypted “root” folder per storage (e.g., `drive:/Encrypted`, `s3:my-bucket/enc/`).
3. Pick filename mode: Decide if you will encrypt filenames (recommended) or keep them visible for compatibility.
4. Create strong passphrases: Use a password manager. Consider a separate salt for filenames.
5. Key backup: Store passphrases in an offline vault. Losing them means permanent data loss.
6. Secure your rclone config: Set a master Config Password so `rclone.conf` is encrypted. See: /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings
7. Test small: Encrypt and transfer a tiny folder first; verify you can decrypt by browsing the crypt remote in RcloneView.

## Step 2 – Configure encrypted remotes in RcloneView

You’ll create two layers: a base remote (Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, etc.) and a crypt remote that wraps it.

1. Add base remotes
   - Google Drive: /support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login
   - OneDrive or SharePoint: /support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/connect-using-cli/add-sharepoint-for-business
   - S3/Wasabi/R2: /support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3 and /support/howto/cloud-storage-setting/cloudflare-r2-credential
2. Create a crypt remote
   - Click `+ New Remote` → choose `crypt`.
   - For “Remote to encrypt/decrypt,” browse to your base remote path, e.g., `Drive:/Encrypted` or `S3:my-bucket/enc/`.
   - Set a strong password and (optionally) a separate salt.
   - Select filename encryption mode: “Standard” (recommended) or “Off” if you must keep names visible.
   - Save. Your crypt remote appears in Explorer. Opening it shows decrypted, readable files; the underlying base path shows encrypted objects.

Tip: Protect your configuration by enabling a Config Password under Embedded Rclone → Advanced Options. See: /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings

## Step 3 – Run encrypted transfers

You can move data into or between encrypted remotes using the same three patterns you already know.

### A) Drag & Drop

- Open a local folder on one side and your crypt remote on the other, then drag to upload encrypted files.  
  See: /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage#copying-files-using-drag-and-drop

### B) Compare

- Open a source (local or another crypt remote) and destination crypt remote. Run Compare to preview changes, then copy only what’s needed.  
  See: /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents#compare-results-and-manage-files

<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-display-select.png" alt="Compare and select differences before copying" class="img-medium img-center" />

### C) Sync & Scheduled Job

- Use Sync to mirror a folder into your crypt remote. Always dry‑run first, then save the job and schedule hourly or nightly runs.  
  See: /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages, /support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs, /support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution

<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/job-run-click.png" alt="Run a saved sync job in RcloneView" class="img-medium img-center" />

Pro tips

- Cold + hot: Keep an encrypted copy in S3/Wasabi and a collaboration copy in Google Drive/OneDrive (encrypted or plaintext per policy).
- Bandwidth limits: Throttle or schedule large jobs outside business hours.
- Server‑side features: You can still use S3 versioning/lifecycle on ciphertext; it remains encrypted at rest.

## Conclusion – Key takeaways and next steps

- Client‑side encryption with rclone crypt keeps both content and filenames private—only you hold the keys.
- RcloneView wraps crypt in a clean GUI, so you can encrypt on Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, Wasabi, R2, and more without CLI.
- Use Compare for safe previews, Sync for automation, and schedule jobs for resilience.
- Back up your passphrases and test recovery. Without keys, data cannot be recovered.
