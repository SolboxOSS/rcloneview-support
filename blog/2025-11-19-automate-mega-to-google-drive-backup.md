# Backup MEGA to Google Drive Automatically with RcloneView -- No More Manual Downloads

> Stop babysitting MEGA exports and Google Drive uploads; let RcloneView's scheduler clock in every time.

SEO tools show that the demand for MEGA -> Google Drive workflows keeps climbing, yet most tutorials still stop at manual drag-and-drop:
- `mega to google drive` -- 30K+ monthly searches
- `transfer mega to google drive` -- 14K+ monthly searches
- `mega backup google drive` -- 8K+ monthly searches

This guide adds the missing automation layer. You will connect MEGA and Google Drive once inside RcloneView, design a repeatable copy or sync plan, and hand it off to the Scheduler so backups run even when you're offline.

## Why manual MEGA downloads slow teams down

Large MEGA folders are throttled when exported through the browser, links expire, and files arrive as multi-GB ZIP archives that must be extracted again before uploading to Google Drive. Repeating that loop creates several issues:

- **Clock-heavy workflows**: manual downloads upload double the data and keep someone glued to a progress bar.
- **Error-prone steps**: pausing a browser transfer corrupts archives, while Drive rejects resumed uploads that exceed the 750 GB/day quota.
- **No audit trail**: it's hard to prove what was copied and when.

| Task | Manual approach | RcloneView automation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transfer path | Download -> unzip -> upload | Direct cloud-to-cloud copy via rclone |
| Consistency | Depends on human action | Scheduler enforces cadence with retries |
| Visibility | Browser tabs | Job history with logs, bandwidth charts, and compare reports |
| Scale | One folder at a time | Queue multiple jobs, run concurrently, reuse presets |

## Prerequisites: install RcloneView and connect both clouds

1. [Download the latest RcloneView build](https://rcloneview.com/src/download.html) and sign in with your license or free tier.
2. Add MEGA via `+ New Remote` and follow the [MEGA connection guide](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/mega) (session ID or email/password + 2FA).
3. Add Google Drive using OAuth per the [remote setup instructions](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/intro#step-2-adding-remote-storage-google-drive-example).
4. Confirm both remotes in Explorer; keep their names simple (`mega-prod`, `gdrive-archive`) so jobs stay readable.
5. Optional but recommended: enable [Compare folders](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents) and checksum defaults in **Settings -> Transfers** for better verification.

## Map your first MEGA -> Google Drive transfer

Before automating, design the exact copy/sync behavior:

1. Open **Explorer** and split the view so MEGA is on the left, Google Drive on the right.
2. Use **Compare** to preview deltas between source and destination; this catches stale or already-moved folders without running a job.
3. Test manual operations:
   - Drag & drop files or folders.
   - Right-click -> **Copy**, **Move**, or **Sync** to open the job wizard with the selected paths pre-filled.
   - Apply include/exclude filters (for example: include `/Projects/**`, exclude `/cache/**`).
4. Watch throughput and API usage in the transfer pane; this informs future scheduler settings (transfers, checkers, bandwidth caps).

Once the dry run looks correct, you're ready to save it as a job.

## Build a hands-free Scheduler job

### Step-by-step scheduler recipe

1. Go to **Job Manager -> Add Job**.
2. Pick **Copy** (keeps MEGA untouched) or **Sync** (mirrors MEGA inside Drive). For archival backups, Copy is safer.
3. Select the MEGA source folder and Google Drive destination folder; you can nest Drive paths like `gdrive-archive:mega-auto-backup`.
4. Configure filters and options:
   - Enable **Compare checksum** to avoid re-copying identical files even when timestamps change.
   - Set `--transfers` (default 4) higher for faster broadband, lower for congested links.
   - Turn on **Versioned target folder** if you want RcloneView to append date stamps such as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
5. On the **Schedule** step, toggle **Enable Scheduler** and pick:
   - Cadence: hourly for critical workspaces, nightly for regular archives.
   - Start window: run outside Drive's busiest hours (e.g., 02:00 local).
   - Retries: 3 attempts with exponential backoff.
6. Activate **Notifications** (email or webhook) for success/failure alerts if your plan supports it.
7. Save and hit **Dry Run** once. When the preview is clean, flip the job status to **Active**.

RcloneView surfaces the underlying rclone command so advanced users can copy it for CLI automation. A typical sync looks like:

```bash
rclone sync mega-prod:Work gdrive-archive:MEGA-AutoBackup ^
  --create-empty-src-dirs ^
  --check-first ^
  --drive-stop-on-upload-limit ^
  --mega-hard-delete=false
```

You never need to paste this manually, but it shows how the Scheduler constructs reliable jobs under the hood.

## Optimize reliability and speed

Automation thrives on predictability. A few tweaks ensure MEGA -> Google Drive runs survive throttles and quotas:

- **Respect Drive's 750 GB/day limit**: split massive migrations into multiple scheduled jobs that target different folders or days.
- **Chunking & concurrency**: set transfer threads to 4-8 for 1 Gbps links; reduce to 2 if MEGA starts throttling.
- **Checksum-first compares**: combined with the Compare view, this prevents duplicate uploads when MEGA updates metadata but not file contents.
- **Bandwidth caps**: throttle uploads in **Settings -> Transfers** so nightly jobs do not swamp shared offices.
- **Incremental strategy**: run a nightly Copy for hot folders and a weekly Sync for cold archives; both can reuse the same remotes.
- **Encryption**: if you use MEGA's client-side encrypted folders, keep them as-is and let Drive house the encrypted blobs; RcloneView copies them byte-for-byte.

## Monitor, verify, and recover faster

Scheduled jobs matter only if you can prove they ran:

- **Job history**: every Scheduler run logs start/end time, bytes transferred, exit code, and a link to verbose logs.
- **Compare view**: after an automated copy, use [Compare folders](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents) to verify zero-delta status or to spot intentional drifts.
- **Transfer panel**: watch progress bars, bandwidth charts, and per-file updates while a job is live.
- **Retry & resume**: if Google Drive hits an upload limit, RcloneView marks the job as `Paused - limit hit` and automatically resumes at the next window when you enable `--drive-stop-on-upload-limit`.
- **Audit-ready exports**: copy the log file or CSV summary per job when you need compliance evidence.

## Real-world automation playbook

| Team | Problem | Scheduler solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Video editors | MEGA desktop sync saturates workstations overnight | Create a Copy job that pushes `/Studio/RAW` to Drive between 01:00-05:00 with 8 transfers and a 200 Mbps cap |
| SaaS startups | Need Google Workspace search but keep MEGA for encrypted originals | Run nightly Copy jobs to Drive for collaboration, keep MEGA as immutable source |
| Agencies | Multiple MEGA client vaults go stale | Queue per-client jobs with staggered schedules and consistent naming in Job Manager for quicker reporting |
| Compliance teams | Need proof of retention | Versioned folders plus Compare reports deliver weekly evidence without manual exports |

## Frequently asked automation questions

**Does RcloneView need my PC to stay awake?**  
Yes, the Scheduler runs locally, so enable "Launch at login" and keep the workstation or server online. For 24/7 reliability, install RcloneView on a lightweight Windows Server or Linux VM.

**Can I keep MEGA as the source of truth while collaborating in Drive?**  
Absolutely. Use Copy jobs so MEGA stays untouched, and pair them with Drive Shared Drives for collaboration. Add a weekly Sync job back to MEGA if you also need bi-directional protection.

**What happens if the job is interrupted?**  
RcloneView writes checkpoints via rclone. When the Scheduler retries, it compares checksums and resumes only the missing blocks, so you never re-transfer finished files.

## Ready to reclaim your time?

Automating MEGA -> Google Drive backups frees you from late-night download/upload babysitting and removes human error from the equation. Build the workflow once in RcloneView, let the Scheduler enforce it, and focus on higher-value work.
