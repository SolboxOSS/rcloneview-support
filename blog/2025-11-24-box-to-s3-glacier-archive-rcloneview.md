# Box to S3 + Glacier: Tiered Archives with RcloneView

> Move Box libraries into Amazon S3 for active access and Glacier for long-term retention, with visual compares, checksum-verified syncs, and scheduled jobs -- no CLI flags required.

Box is great for collaboration, but long-term retention and large media libraries can get expensive. RcloneView lets you mirror Box folders into S3 buckets for hot access, then push aging data into Glacier classes on a schedule. You get side-by-side compares, logged jobs, and retries without babysitting scripts.

## What We Are Solving

- Reduce Box storage spend by tiering cold data into Glacier.
- Keep an always-available S3 copy for active teams while Glacier holds the history.
- Maintain integrity with checksum-verified jobs and an audit trail.

## Connect Box and S3 Remotes Fast

- Add Box and S3 remotes via `+ New Remote`. OAuth and key setup: [add-oath-online-login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login), [s3](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3).

- Use **Remote Explorer** to sanity-check folder depth and naming before the first sync.

- Optional: mount either remote locally for quick spot checks: [mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive).

## Compare Before You Move

- Run **Compare** between Box and the target S3 prefix to see missing or newer files before committing: [compare-folder-contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents).
- Filter by extensions (e.g., PDFs, CAD, media) to scope reviews.

## Build a Two-Tier Pipeline (S3 Hot, Glacier Cold)

- Step 1: Create a **copy** job from Box to S3 for the active tier: [create-sync-jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs). Start with copy for safety; switch to sync after validating results.

- Step 2: Apply S3 lifecycle policies on the bucket to transition objects to Glacier classes after N days. Keep the RcloneView job targeting the hot prefix (e.g., `s3:box-archive/hot/`).
- Step 3: For deep archives, schedule a secondary job to push rarely used folders directly to a Glacier-focused prefix (e.g., `s3:box-archive/cold/`).

RcloneView gives you a visual, repeatable way to exit Box, cut storage costs, and keep compliant archives in AWS. Compare first, copy safely, schedule the rest -- and sleep easy.
