# Troubleshooting rclone Errors with RcloneView: Fix API Limits, Permissions, Timeouts, and More

> Rclone is powerful, but errors like 403 rate limits, timeouts, or "permission denied" can stall a migration. RcloneView combines CLI visibility with GUI context so you can spot the cause faster and fix it safely.

If you have ever stared at a wall of rclone output wondering why a job failed, RcloneView can shorten the loop. The built-in Terminal, verbose logs, and Job History help you reproduce issues, isolate failing files, and adjust performance or authentication settings without leaving the app.

## Why rclone errors happen

- API limits and quotas: 403 or 429 responses from Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.
- Authentication scope issues: expired tokens or missing permissions.
- Path and permission mismatches: shared drives, external folders, or wrong root paths.
- Network conditions: timeouts, throttling, or unstable links.
- Integrity checks: checksum mismatches when providers alter uploads.

## Common errors and what they mean

| Error | What it usually means | Quick next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 403: Rate Limit Exceeded / 429 Too Many Requests | Provider throttled requests | Lower `--transfers`, add `--tpslimit`, retry with backoff |
| Failed to copy: permission denied | Missing access to folder or file | Verify path, check shared drive permissions, re-auth with correct scope |
| Failed to refresh token | OAuth token expired or invalid | Reconnect the remote via RcloneView OAuth flow |
| Directory not found | Path typo or wrong root | Confirm path using `rclone lsf remote:` |
| Timeout waiting for connection | Network instability or firewall | Reduce parallelism, retry with `--retries` and `--low-level-retries` |
| Upload failed: corrupted on transfer | Integrity check failed | Re-run with `--checksum` or `rclone check` |

## Use the RcloneView Terminal to reproduce and inspect errors

Re-run the failing command inside the built-in Terminal to remove variables like wrong working directories or configs.

- Open the **Terminal** tab and type `rclone ` to see all commands (autocomplete). [Guide](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/using-terminal-in-rcloneview)
- Add `-vv` to capture verbose output you can copy or share.

Examples:

```bash
rclone about myremote: -vv
rclone lsf myremote:path -vv --dirs-only --recursive
rclone sync src: dst: -vv --transfers=8
```

## Check Job Logs and History to find patterns

The Job Monitor and History views show which files failed and how often.

- **Job Monitor**: live Transfer tab for active jobs, plus Completed/API logs for finished runs. [See steps](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring)
- **History**: open a specific job’s History from the Job Manager to review per-file outcomes. [See steps](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job)

## Fix API rate limit and quota errors

- Lower concurrency: reduce `--transfers` and `--checkers` in the job options or command flags.
- Add polite throttling: use `--tpslimit` and `--tpslimit-burst` for providers with strict APIs.
- Split big jobs: run folder-by-folder or schedule during off-peak hours via Job Manager.
- Use incremental runs: combine Compare + Sync to move only changed files and reduce calls.

## Fix authentication and OAuth issues

- Re-authenticate the remote with the correct scope using RcloneView’s OAuth prompts.
- If a token is expired or revoked, recreate the remote or refresh it via the Terminal with `rclone config reconnect remote:`.
- For shared drives or delegated accounts, confirm the remote is set with the right drive or tenant IDs.

## Fix permission denied errors

- Confirm the path exists and you have access: `rclone lsf remote:folder` in Terminal.
- For Google shared drives or Dropbox shared folders, ensure the remote uses the correct root or drive ID.
- If copying into a shared drive, verify you have write permissions; otherwise choose a destination you own.

## Fix timeouts and unstable connections

- Reduce parallelism for fragile links: `--transfers=2 --checkers=2`.
- Increase retry behavior: `--retries=10 --retries-sleep=5s --low-level-retries=20`.
- For large files, enable multi-thread streaming: `--multi-thread-streams=4 --multi-thread-cutoff=64M`.
- Test reachability from the Terminal with a lightweight command before large syncs:

```bash
rclone lsf remote: --max-depth 1 --fast-list -vv
```

## Fix data integrity and checksum errors

- Verify sources and destinations with a dry run: `--dry-run` on Sync or Copy jobs.
- Use `rclone check` to compare checksums between two remotes:

```bash
rclone check source:folder dest:folder --one-way --size-only
```

- Enable checksum comparison on supported providers to detect silent corruption.

## When to use GUI vs Terminal

- **GUI**: create jobs, schedule recurring backups, Compare before syncing, drag-and-drop across clouds.
- **Terminal**: diagnose errors quickly, test backend flags, or run ad-hoc commands with full `-vv` logs.
- Use both: prototype in Terminal, then save stable commands as reusable jobs.

## Quick troubleshooting checklist

1. Reproduce the error in Terminal with `-vv` and copy logs.
2. Check Job Monitor and History for failing files and frequency.
3. Apply the fix category: rate limits (lower concurrency), auth (re-auth), permissions (verify path/root), network (reduce threads, increase retries), integrity (run `check`).
4. Re-run with `--dry-run` before making changes.

## Conclusion

RcloneView turns rclone debugging into a guided workflow: autocomplete to avoid syntax mistakes, in-app logs to see what failed, and GUI controls to tune concurrency or schedules. Use the Terminal and Job History together to resolve errors faster and keep transfers moving.
