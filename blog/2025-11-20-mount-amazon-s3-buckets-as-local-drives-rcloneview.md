# Mount Amazon S3 Buckets as Local Drives with RcloneView (Windows & macOS)

> Developers search "mount S3 bucket Windows" over 22K times each month. RcloneView answers with a two-click GUI instead of a 20-flag `rclone mount` script.

Amazon S3 is everywhere: logs, ML artifacts, backups, and static websites. Yet the official tools make you download files manually or write custom scripts with WinFsp, macFUSE, cache flags, and watchdog daemons. RcloneView wraps the proven `rclone mount` engine in a desktop UI so engineers, admins, and creators can expose any bucket (or compatible service like Wasabi, R2, Backblaze B2) as a native drive on Windows or macOS.

## Why Pick RcloneView Instead of DIY CLI Mounts

- **Guided IAM setup**: Remote Manager walks you through keys, roles, and endpoints using the [Amazon S3 guide](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/s3) so credentials stay scoped.
- **Driver helpers**: WinFsp and macFUSE prompts are embedded; no manual downloads or registry edits.
- **Template-driven mounts**: Mount Manager stores every S3 mount with cache size, drive letter, and auto-start toggles.
- **Multi-cloud extras**: While S3 is mounted, you can Compare, Sync, or Copy to Google Drive, Dropbox, Wasabi, NAS, or external disks in the same UI.
- **Monitoring + scheduler**: Built-in Scheduler restarts mounts after reboot.

## Step 1 -- Prep Your Desktop & IAM

1. **Install RcloneView** (includes rclone). On Windows accept WinFsp; on macOS approve macFUSE security prompts.
2. **Plan IAM access**: create a role/user limited to the buckets you plan to mount (read-only for analysts, read/write for staging tools).

## Step 2 -- Add S3 and Other Clouds

- Open **Remote Manager** and click *Add Remote* -> *Amazon S3* (or compatible). Paste Access Key, Secret, region, and optional endpoints per the S3 guide.
- Name the remote `s3-prod-logs` (and add others like `s3-staging`, Wasabi, R2). Use the Notes field to describe retention and conversion rules.

## Step 3 -- Mount from Explorer or Mount Manager

1. In the dual-pane Explorer, select your S3 remote and click the **Mount icon**.
2. Choose drive letter/volume, cache size, read-only vs read/write, and whether to expose the bucket root or a subfolder.
3. Click **Mount** and the bucket appears instantly inside File Explorer or Finder. [Mount Cloud Storage as a Local Drive](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive)

Mount Manager (Remote -> Mount Manager) keeps every mount as a reusable profile. Flip on **Auto Mount at startup**, specify reconnect retries, and add reminders for IAM rotation dates.


## Step 4 -- Automate Workflows Around the Mount

Mounts are just the start. RcloneView lets you layer automation:

- **Compare** the mounted bucket vs. a local folder to verify deployments (see [Compare folder contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents)).

- **Sync** S3 to external drives or NAS using [Create sync jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs) and [Synchronize remote storages](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages) for nightlies.

- **Multi-cloud hops**: keep Google Drive, Dropbox, or Wasabi mounts open simultaneously to drag files across Finder/Explorer windows.

## Use Cases Developers Love

- **Log analysis**: Mount S3 logs on macOS, grep locally, then detach. No `aws s3 sync` clutter.
- **Data science staging**: Point Jupyter or VS Code at the mounted drive to load parquet/CSV files without copying to laptop storage.
- **Backup verification**: Mount Glacier or Object Lock buckets read-only while Scheduler copies hot data elsewhere.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Does RcloneView support custom S3 endpoints (Wasabi, R2, MinIO)?**  
Yes. Use the same S3 remote wizard, set the endpoint, and mount it like any other bucket.

**How do I mount only a folder, not the entire bucket?**  
Use the "Mount path" field to point to `bucket/prefix`, or create Explorer bookmarks for the folder before launching the mount.

## Ready to Replace Mount Scripts?

RcloneView condenses what used to be a README of CLI flags into a few clicks: add your S3 remote once, save the mount template, and let Scheduler reattach it on every boot. Along the way you gain Compare previews, Sync jobs, multi-cloud Explorer panes, and monitoring dashboards from the same app.
