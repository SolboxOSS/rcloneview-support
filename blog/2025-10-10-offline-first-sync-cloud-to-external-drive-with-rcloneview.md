# Offline First: Keep Your Cloud Data Synced Locally on External Drives

> Stay connected—even when you’re not. Use **RcloneView** to sync your **cloud data** (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, S3, and more) to a **local or external drive** so your files remain accessible offline, secure, and portable—no command line needed.

## Why sync cloud data to an external drive

When you’re on the move—traveling, shooting photos, working remotely, or editing offline—you can’t always rely on stable internet. Having a local mirror of your cloud folders on a portable SSD or HDD ensures you can keep working, even without connectivity.  
<!-- truncate -->

**Key reasons to go offline-first**

- **Work anywhere:** open and edit your files without internet access.  
- **Redundancy:** protect your data against cloud outages or accidental deletions.  
- **Portability:** carry your important projects between machines easily.  
- **Backup safety:** add another physical layer to your 3-2-1 backup strategy (3 copies, 2 media types, 1 off-site).  

## Cloud meets portability — the perfect pair

| Cloud Platform | Why Sync Locally | Typical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Drive** | Edit Docs offline, back up media, stage large uploads | Creators, students, remote workers |
| **OneDrive** | Access Office files anywhere, speed up syncs | Office 365 users, enterprises |
| **Dropbox** | Offline review of shared folders | Collaborators, designers |
| **Amazon S3 / Wasabi / R2** | Local backups of object storage | Developers, archivists |
| **Proton Drive** | Encrypted local mirrors | Privacy-conscious professionals |

> With RcloneView, you can treat your **external drive** just like another workspace—browse, compare, and sync side-by-side.

## Step 1 — Preparation

Before connecting your clouds:

1. **Check your Local tab** — external drives and internal folders are automatically displayed under **Local** in RcloneView.  
2. **Check capacity** — ensure there’s enough free space for your cloud folders.  
5. *(Optional)* **Plan filters** — exclude cache files, temporary folders, or huge archives.

## Step 2 — Connect your cloud storage in RcloneView

RcloneView’s visual wizard makes setup easy.

1. Launch **RcloneView** → click **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Add your **cloud provider** (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, or S3).  
3. Once connected, switch to the **Local tab** and **create a folder** on your desired drive (for example, `E:\MyCloudBackup` or `/Volumes/Portable/GoogleDriveSync`).  
4. Confirm both the **cloud remote** and the **local folder** appear side-by-side in the Explorer panel.

## Step 3 — Sync and stay offline-ready

RcloneView gives you three flexible methods to manage your cloud-to-drive sync.

### A) **Drag & Drop (Manual Copy)**  
Browse your cloud on one side and your local folder on the other—then **drag folders or files across** for one-off copies.  

👉 See more: [Copying Files using Drag and Drop](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage#copying-files-using-drag-and-drop)

### B) **Compare & Copy (Preview Differences)**  
Run **Compare** to see what’s new or changed between your cloud folder and your drive.  
Copy only the updates, skipping duplicates or old versions.

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs (Automated Backup)**  
Use **Sync** to automatically mirror your selected cloud folders to your local drive (e.g., every night or before travel).  
Run a **dry-run** first, then save it as a **Job** for reuse.

## Pro tips

- **Label your drives clearly** (e.g., “WorkBackupSSD”) so scheduled jobs always find the right target.  
- **Use incremental syncs** — only copy changes instead of the whole drive.  
- **Keep logs** — RcloneView’s job history shows what synced and when.  
- **Test restores** — periodically check that offline copies open correctly.  
- **Secure your backups** — encrypt sensitive folders or use rclone crypt for extra protection.

## Conclusion — Stay productive, even offline

- **Why it matters:** you stay in control of your files even without internet access.  
- **How it works:** connect your cloud and use the **Local tab** in RcloneView to mirror or back up your folders using **Drag & Drop**, **Compare**, or **Sync Jobs**.  
- **Bonus:** automate your workflow and travel light—your data stays both secure and portable.
