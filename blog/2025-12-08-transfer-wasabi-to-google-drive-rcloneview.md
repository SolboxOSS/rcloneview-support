# Transfer Files Between Wasabi and Google Drive with RcloneView

> Move terabytes from Wasabi to Google Drive (or back) without juggling command lines. RcloneView layers rclone’s speed and S3 tuning into a guided GUI so you can compare, sync, and schedule migrations confidently.

RcloneView supports both S3-compatible storage like Wasabi and Google Drive’s OAuth flow. Open both remotes side-by-side, choose Explorer/Compare/Sync based on your workflow, and apply S3-friendly chunking to keep large uploads stable.

## Wasabi vs Google Drive at a glance

- **Wasabi**: S3 API, fast ingest, low storage cost, per-bucket endpoints (e.g., `s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com`).
- **Google Drive / Workspace**: Familiar sharing, strong collaboration, API quotas to consider during bursts.
- **RcloneView**: One UI for both-compare before syncing, drag-and-drop, run dry runs, and schedule repeat jobs.

## Add a Wasabi remote (S3-compatible)

1. Click **`+ New Remote`** -> choose **S3**.
2. Enter your **Access Key** / **Secret Key**, bucket region, and endpoint (e.g., `s3.wasabisys.com` or region-specific URL).
3. Save as `Wasabi_Archive` (or similar) for clarity.

## Connect Google Drive with OAuth

1. In **`+ New Remote`**, pick **Google Drive**.
2. Sign in via the browser OAuth prompt and confirm the account or Workspace you’ll migrate to.
3. Name it (e.g., `GDrive_Workspace`).

## Open both clouds side-by-side

1. In **Explorer -> Browse**, open your **Wasabi** remote on one side and **Google Drive** on the other.
2. Navigate to the source bucket/folder and the target Drive folder.  


## Choose the best transfer method

- **Drag & Drop (Explorer)**: Quick copies for selected folders. Progress appears in **Transfer** logs.
- **Compare -> Copy**: Preview differences first; copy missing/newer files with confidence.
- **Sync**: One-way mirror for ongoing backups (Wasabi -> Drive or reverse). Add **`--dry-run`** first to validate.

## Build a scheduled backup job

1. After a successful Sync, click **Save to Jobs**.
2. Open **Job Manager** -> **Add Job** (or edit the saved one) and set the schedule (e.g., nightly).
3. Keep **Backup Dir** or versioned folders to preserve changed/deleted items on Drive.
4. Monitor in **Transfer** tab and **History** for per-job outcomes.

## Migration checklist (integrity + safety)

- Run a **Compare** first to see what will move; export results if needed.
- Start with **`--dry-run`** on Sync to avoid surprises.
- For critical data, validate with `rclone check source: dest:` in the built-in Terminal and review **API logs**.
- Use distinct destination folders (e.g., `Wasabi_Archive_2025`) until you verify integrity.
- Document jobs with clear names (`Wasabi->GDrive_Nightly`) and keep endpoints/keys scoped to the needed bucket.

## Wrap-up

With RcloneView, Wasabi’s S3 performance and Google Drive’s collaboration live in one interface. Create both remotes, preview changes, tune S3 uploads, and schedule recurring jobs-all without editing configs or CLI flags. Start your Wasabi -> Google Drive migration today and keep every run verifiable.
