# Securely Back Up and Sync Your Hard Drive with OneDrive Using RcloneView

> Keep your files safe, organized, and accessible anywhere by moving data from your hard drive to OneDrive with RcloneView.


## Protecting Your Data: Backing Up a Hard Drive to OneDrive

Hard drives are essential for daily work, storing personal files, projects, and multimedia. However, they are **vulnerable to risks** such as hardware failure, theft, or accidental deletion. Relying only on local storage can put your valuable data at risk.

**OneDrive**, part of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, provides cloud storage that integrates seamlessly with Windows and Office applications. By backing up or syncing your hard drive to OneDrive, you add an extra layer of **security, accessibility, and collaboration**.

### Understanding Hard Drives
- Store files locally, fast access but limited redundancy  
- Susceptible to hardware crashes, malware, or accidental loss  
- Great for offline use but not built for collaboration  

### Understanding OneDrive
- Cloud-based storage included with Microsoft 365  
- Accessible from Windows PCs, mobile devices, and the web  
- Offers ~5 GB free storage with scalable paid plans  
- Strong versioning, file recovery, and integration with Office and Teams  

### Why transfer from a hard drive to OneDrive?
- **Backup & Protection**: Guard against hardware failure or data loss  
- **Remote Access**: Work on files anywhere, anytime  
- **Collaboration**: Share and co-edit seamlessly with colleagues or classmates  
- **Free up space**: Optimize local storage while keeping files available in the cloud  


## Step 1 – Preparation

Before you begin:

1. **Organize your hard drive**  
   Remove unnecessary or duplicate files to speed up transfers.  

2. **Check available OneDrive storage**  
   Ensure you have enough quota (consider upgrading if needed).  

3. **Back up critical files locally**  
   Always keep a secondary backup copy for safety.  

4. **Plan your strategy**  
   Decide between a one-time migration, recurring sync, or selective transfers.

## Step 2 – Set Up Connections in RcloneView

RcloneView makes setup simple:

1. Open **RcloneView** → click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Select **OneDrive** → complete Microsoft OAuth login → name it (e.g., `MyOneDrive`)  
3. Add your **hard drive folder** using the **Local** provider (e.g., `D:\Backups` or `/Users/Name/Documents`)  
4. Both locations will now appear side by side in the Explorer pane  


## Step 3 – Running Backup and Sync Jobs

With connections ready, you can move data from your hard drive to OneDrive in three ways:

### A) **Drag & Drop**
- Navigate both panes → drag files/folders from hard drive to OneDrive  
- Ideal for quick, manual transfers  

### B) **Compare & Select**
- Run a **Compare** to see what’s new or changed  
- Copy or update only what’s needed  
- Perfect for incremental backups  

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs**
- **Sync** ensures OneDrive mirrors your hard drive folder  
- Run **dry-run** previews before executing large transfers  
- Automate backups with **Scheduled Jobs** (e.g., nightly sync)  

**Pro Tips:**  
- Exclude unnecessary file types (e.g., `.tmp`, `.log`)  
- Start small to validate your setup  
- Track job history via the built-in Job Monitor
