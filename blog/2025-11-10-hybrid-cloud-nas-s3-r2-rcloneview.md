# Hybrid Cloud Made Easy: Combine NAS, S3, and Cloudflare R2 in One Workflow

> Bridge your on-prem NAS with S3-compatible clouds and Cloudflare R2 using RcloneView’s visual workflows.

## Why hybrid cloud storage is trending in 2025

Teams want LAN-speed collaboration plus cloud durability and edge delivery. That means:

- A **NAS** (Synology, QNAP, TrueNAS, etc.) keeps day-to-day files close to the team.  
- **Amazon S3 or Wasabi** stores long-term backups, analytics data, or compliance snapshots.  
- **Cloudflare R2** pushes content to users globally without surprise egress bills.

Juggling these manually is painful—different portals, scripts, and cron jobs. RcloneView unifies them:

- Add NAS (via SMB/NFS/WebDAV), S3-compatible buckets, and Cloudflare R2 in the same Explorer.  
- Use Compare, drag-and-drop, and Jobs to automate every leg of the workflow.  
- Track history, alerts, and dry runs to keep hybrid operations auditable.

## Reference architecture

1. **Local NAS tier** – Primary collaboration volume or surveillance archive.  
2. **S3 tier** – Durable off-site copy with lifecycle policies (Std → Glacier/IA).  
3. **Cloudflare R2 tier** – Edge-friendly repository for web sites, downloads, or CDN workloads.

RcloneView becomes the control plane. You can visually orchestrate:

- NAS → S3 nightly backups.  
- S3 → R2 replication for distribution.  
- On-demand restores from R2/S3 down to NAS for local editing.

## Step 1 – Prep your endpoints

1. **NAS:** Enable an S3-compatible service (many NAS devices expose MinIO-style gateways) or enable SMB/WebDAV for direct mounts.  
2. **S3:** Create dedicated IAM users with bucket-level permissions.  
3. **Cloudflare R2:** Generate API tokens scoped to the required buckets.  
4. **Connectivity:** Verify NAS can reach the internet via HTTPS; open ports if running reverse proxies.  
5. **Cost planning:** Model data flows—NAS→S3 traffic leaves your ISP, S3→R2 incurs egress from S3 only.

---

## Step 2 – Add remotes in RcloneView

1. Launch **RcloneView** → **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Pick the backend type:
   - **S3 compatible** for Amazon, Wasabi, or your NAS gateway (enter custom endpoint/IP).  
   - **WebDAV/SMB** if your NAS exposes file shares.  
   - **Cloudflare R2** using the account-specific endpoint.  
3. Give each remote a clear label (`NAS_Studio`, `S3_Archive`, `R2_Distribution`).  
4. Test connections; they should appear in the Explorer pane ready for drag-and-drop transfers.

## Step 3 – Build hybrid workflows

### A) NAS → S3 backup lane
- Use **Compare** to preview NAS folders against S3 buckets.  
- Run **Sync** with `--backup-dir` enabled to move changed files into dated prefixes.  
- Save as a Job (`NAS_to_S3_Nightly`) and schedule during off-hours.

### B) S3 → Cloudflare R2 publishing lane
- After backups land in S3, duplicate key prefixes into R2 for low-latency delivery.  
- Use **Dry Run** first to confirm object counts.  
- Enable notifications so the web team knows when new builds hit R2.

### C) R2/S3 → NAS restore lane
- Open a dual-pane view (R2 left, NAS right).  
- Drag specific folders back for local editing or disaster recovery.  
- Track restores in **Job History** to prove RPO/RTO compliance.

## Automation playbook

1. **Template jobs:** Clone base jobs (e.g., “NAS→S3 Sync”) for each department to keep rules consistent.  
2. **Tag schedules:** Prefix job names with `[Backup]`, `[Publish]`, `[Restore]` for fast filtering.  
3. **Use retention rules:** Pair RcloneView jobs with S3 lifecycle policies so warm data ages into cheaper tiers automatically.  
4. **Monitor telemetry:** Export job logs weekly and ship to your SIEM or Slack to keep stakeholders looped in.  
5. **Test failover:** Quarterly, simulate a NAS outage and restore from S3/R2 to validate documentation.

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Slow NAS uploads?** Enable multipart uploads and increase concurrency in Job settings.  
- **Mismatched timestamps?** Use Compare’s metadata pane to identify time-zone drift before syncing.  
- **Permission errors?** Double-check IAM policies for S3 and token scopes in R2; NAS shares may require service accounts.  
- **Version conflicts?** Turn on `--checksum` for critical archives or enable backup directories to retain old revisions.  
- **Bandwidth spikes?** Throttle jobs during business hours and let off-hours windows run at full speed.

## FAQs

**Q. Do I need CLI access on the NAS?**  
**A.** No. As long as the NAS exposes an S3/WebDAV/SMB endpoint reachable from the machine running RcloneView, you can manage it entirely from the GUI.

**Q. Can I encrypt data in transit between NAS and S3?**  
**A.** Yes. Use HTTPS endpoints and optionally enable rclone’s server-side encryption parameters when configuring the remote inside RcloneView.

**Q. What’s the best way to handle large media libraries?**  
**A.** Break them into prefix-based jobs (e.g., `/projects/a-m/`) and stagger schedules to stay within API rate limits.

**Q. Does Cloudflare R2 charge for ingress when pulling from S3?**  
**A.** No, but S3 will charge egress. Budget for that when planning the S3 → R2 publishing lane.
