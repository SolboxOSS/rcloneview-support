# How to Encrypt Cloud Backups: Secure Google Drive, OneDrive, and S3 with RcloneView

> Keep your sensitive files safe‚Äîeven in the cloud. With **RcloneView**, you can encrypt and manage your cloud backups visually using rclone‚Äôs **crypt** backend, ensuring complete privacy for Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, and more‚Äîno scripting needed.

## Why encrypt your cloud backups?

Cloud storage is convenient and reliable, but your files still live on someone else‚Äôs servers. Without encryption, service providers (or anyone who gains access to your account) could read your data.

Encrypting your cloud backups gives you **true ownership** of your information‚Äîonly you hold the decryption key.

**Top reasons to encrypt your data before upload:**

- üîí **Privacy** ‚Äî prevent unauthorized access or leaks.  
- üß© **Compliance** ‚Äî meet organizational or legal data security standards.  
- üíº **Control** ‚Äî choose your own keys and encryption method.  
- üåê **Portability** ‚Äî move encrypted data between clouds without losing protection.

## Understanding rclone‚Äôs ‚Äúcrypt‚Äù remote

The **crypt** backend is rclone‚Äôs built-in encryption layer. Instead of encrypting files manually before upload, it transparently encrypts filenames, directory structures, and content as data is transferred.

When combined with **RcloneView**, you can configure and manage crypt remotes through a **simple GUI**, making cloud encryption accessible for everyone.

### How it works

1. You set up a ‚Äúbase remote‚Äù ‚Äî for example, your Google Drive, OneDrive, or S3 bucket.  
2. You create a new **crypt remote** that points to a folder within that base remote.  
3. Files uploaded through the crypt remote are encrypted automatically.  
4. When browsing through RcloneView, files appear normally‚Äîbut the cloud only stores encrypted data and names.  

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
| `gdrive:` | Regular Google Drive remote |
| `gdrive-crypt:` | Encrypted layer inside your Google Drive |
| `/gdrive/Encrypted/` | Physical folder that stores encrypted versions of your files |

> Even if someone accesses your cloud account, they‚Äôll only see scrambled filenames and unreadable data.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Preparation

Before creating your encrypted cloud backup:

1. **Decide what to encrypt** ‚Äî whole drive or just specific folders (e.g., `/Private/`, `/Archives/`).  
2. **Choose your target cloud** ‚Äî Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Wasabi, or others supported by rclone.  
3. **Create or locate a secure folder** on the cloud to store encrypted files.  
4. *(Optional)* **Back up unencrypted versions** before applying encryption.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Create an encrypted remote in RcloneView

RcloneView makes creating a crypt remote as simple as a few clicks.

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Choose **Crypt (Encrypted Storage)** as the **remote type**.  
<img src="/support/images/en/blog/add-crypt-remote-1.png" alt="Create encrypted remote in RcloneView" class="img-medium img-center" />
3. Select the **underlying storage** (e.g., your existing `WebDav', 'Google Drive` or `S3` remote).  
4. Specify a **path** within that remote (e.g., `webdav:secure` or `drive:documents/encrypted`).  
<img src="/support/images/en/blog/add-crypt-remote-2.png" alt="Create encrypted remote in RcloneView" class="img-medium img-center" />
5. Set your **encryption password** and optional **salt**.  
   - Use a strong, unique password‚ÄîRcloneView stores it securely on your machine.  
6. Name your encrypted remote (e.g., `WebDav-Encrypted` or `S3-Secure`).  

Once complete, your encrypted remote appears alongside your normal remotes in RcloneView‚Äôs sidebar.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Transfer and sync encrypted data

You can now use all of RcloneView‚Äôs powerful features‚Äî**Drag & Drop**, **Compare**, and **Sync Jobs**‚Äîto handle encrypted transfers between your local files and the crypt remote.

### A) **Drag & Drop**
Simply drag folders from your local drive into your encrypted remote (e.g., `Drive-Encrypted:`).  
RcloneView encrypts each file as it uploads.

---

### B) **Compare & Copy**
Run **Compare** to preview updates and differences between your local folder and the encrypted remote.  
Only changed files will be re-encrypted and uploaded.

üëâ See more: [Compare and Manage Files](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents#compare-results-and-manage-files)

---

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs**
Automate your encryption routine.  
Create a **Sync Job** that mirrors local folders into your crypt remote every night or week‚Äîensuring all new files are encrypted and safely stored off-site.

## Step 4 ‚Äî Verify your encryption

RcloneView allows you to browse encrypted remotes visually, but the cloud-side content remains unreadable.  
To verify:

- Open your cloud drive web interface‚Äîfiles should have **randomized names** and extensions.  
- Try downloading them directly; they‚Äôll appear as encrypted data.  
- Open through RcloneView, and they decrypt transparently.  

This confirms your encryption setup is working correctly.

## Pro tips

- **Backup your configuration file (`rclone.conf`)** securely‚Äîit contains your encryption keys.  
- **Never share your passwords or salts.** Losing them means losing access to your encrypted data.  
- **Combine crypt with compression** (e.g., `.zip` or `.7z`) for efficient encrypted archives.  
- **Test decryption** occasionally to confirm your data is restorable.  
- **Layer encryption**: for extra-sensitive folders, you can stack multiple crypt layers or encrypt across different clouds.

---

## Conclusion ‚Äî Privacy meets simplicity

- **Why it matters:** Encryption ensures your files stay private, even in the cloud.  
- **How it works:** The rclone **crypt remote** encrypts filenames, folders, and content‚Äîmanaged easily through RcloneView‚Äôs GUI.  
- **What you gain:** a seamless way to protect sensitive data across Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, and more.  

> You don‚Äôt need command-line expertise to secure your digital life‚ÄîRcloneView brings powerful encryption to everyone.

## FAQs

**Q. What is a crypt remote?**  
**A.** It‚Äôs an encrypted overlay created in rclone (and managed by RcloneView) that automatically encrypts all files before uploading and decrypts them when accessed locally.
