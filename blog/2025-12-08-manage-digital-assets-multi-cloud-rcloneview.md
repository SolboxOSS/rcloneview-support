# Manage Digital Assets Across Multiple Clouds with RcloneView: A Complete Workflow Guide

> Keep RAW, EDIT, EXPORT, and ARCHIVE in sync across Google Drive, Dropbox, pCloud, Mega, S3/Wasabi, and NAS—without buying an expensive DAM. RcloneView gives media teams a two-pane Explorer, Compare, Sync, and Jobs to tame sprawling cloud folders.

## Why creators struggle with digital assets

- **Huge files:** 4K–8K RAW, project files, proxies, stems, and renders quickly hit TB scale.
- **Many versions:** RAW → EDIT → EXPORT → CLIENT DELIVERY; V1, V2, FINAL, FINAL_FINAL.
- **Lifecycle pressure:** costly hot storage; need cold S3/Wasabi tiers for archives.
- **Team access:** different roles, permissions, and storage silos across services.
- **Fragmentation:** folder conventions differ by cloud, causing collisions and lost time.

## RcloneView: multi-cloud Explorer for media pipelines

- **100+ providers** in one UI: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, Mega, pCloud, S3/Wasabi/B2/R2, WebDAV/SFTP/SMB, NAS/external drives.
- **Two-pane Explorer** to open RAW on one side and EDIT/EXPORT on another.
- **Compare** to see new/changed/matching files before copying.
- **Fast, resilient transfers** with retries, resumable support, and checksums.
- **Sync + Jobs** to automate daily backups and archives.
- **Cross-platform**: Windows/macOS/Linux, no CLI flags required.

## Standardize your folder template (RAW / EDIT / EXPORT / ARCHIVE)

```
Project Name /
 ├─ RAW /
 │   ├─ CAM_A
 │   ├─ CAM_B
 │   ├─ AUDIO
 ├─ EDIT /
 │   ├─ Premiere
 │   ├─ Resolve
 ├─ EXPORT /
 │   ├─ MASTER
 │   ├─ REVIEW
 │   ├─ SOCIAL
 └─ ARCHIVE /
```

Keep this template in a “starter” folder; copy it for every project so teams know exactly where RAW, EDIT, EXPORT, and ARCHIVE belong—regardless of cloud.

## Practical storage map

- **RAW:** NAS or pCloud/Mega for ingest; mirror to Wasabi/S3 weekly.
- **EDIT:** Local SSD for speed + cloud backup (Google Drive/Dropbox).
- **EXPORT:** Google Drive Shared Drives or Dropbox for client review/delivery.
- **ARCHIVE:** Wasabi/B2/S3 cold tier; keep MASTER + key EDIT assets.

RcloneView’s role: maintain this structure across all clouds with drag-and-drop, Compare, Sync, and Jobs.

## Two-pane organization workflow

1. Open **Browse**; load RAW store (e.g., pCloud/Mega) on the left, EDIT/EXPORT store (e.g., Google Drive) on the right.
2. Drag & drop new footage or renders between panes; track in **Transfer**.
3. Use **Compare** to spot new or mismatched files before copying.
4. Keep a “folder template” in each cloud; duplicate it for new projects to enforce structure.

## Archive to low-cost storage (Wasabi/S3)

- Run **Compare** between RAW on primary storage and the archive bucket to move only changes.
- Use **Sync** (one-way).
- Create a **Job** to run weekly (e.g., Monday 03:00) so RAW stays mirrored off-site.

## Share and collaborate via Google Drive/Dropbox

- Sync EXPORT to Google Drive Shared Drives for client review; keep FINAL in a dedicated folder.
- Use **Copy** or **Sync** jobs to push EDIT backups to a team workspace.
- Cross-cloud flows: EXPORT → Google Drive, RAW → Dropbox, ARCHIVE → Wasabi—scheduled for off-hours.

## Automate with Jobs and schedules

- Example daily set:
  - RAW → NAS (local safety)
  - RAW → Wasabi (archive)
  - EDIT → Google Drive (team backup)
  - EXPORT → Shared Drive (client-facing)
- Save each as a **Job** and schedule at night to avoid bandwidth contention.
- Stagger jobs (e.g., 02:00, 02:30, 03:00) for stable throughput.

## Real-world flow (studio example)

- **Ingest:** External SSD → RcloneView upload to RAW (pCloud/Mega); **Compare** to confirm no gaps; weekly one-way **Sync** to Wasabi.
- **Edit:** Work from local SSD; **Sync** EDIT to Google Drive team folder for backup.
- **Export:** Push MASTER/REVIEW/SOCIAL to Google Drive; share links with clients.
- **Archive:** After delivery, **Sync** RAW/EDIT/EXPORT to Wasabi/B2; leave FINAL on Google Drive to save space.

## Logging, retries, and integrity

- Watch **Transfer** for throughput and retries; pause/resume if needed.
- If throttled (429/5xx), lower concurrency or set bandwidth limits, then rerun; only missing changes move.

## Why choose RcloneView over a heavy DAM or single-cloud tool?

- No lock-in to one vendor; 100+ providers in one GUI.
- Two-pane Explorer + Compare to prevent accidental overwrites.
- Scheduler and Jobs built-in (no external cron).
- Runs the same rclone engine trusted by ops teams, wrapped in a friendlier UI.
- Faster onboarding for editors and designers who avoid CLI tools.

## Summary

RcloneView gives creators, studios, and media teams a practical way to manage RAW → EDIT → EXPORT → ARCHIVE across multiple clouds. Standardize your structure, automate backups and archives, verify with Compare and checksums, and keep collaborators in sync—all without buying a complex DAM or writing scripts.
