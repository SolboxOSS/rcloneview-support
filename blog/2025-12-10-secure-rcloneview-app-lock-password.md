# Lock Down RcloneView with App Lock: Protect Remotes, Jobs, and History

> Shared or company PC? Turn on App Lock to require a password before anyone can open RcloneView, keeping remotes, jobs, and transfer history out of sight.

RcloneView’s App Lock adds a simple password screen at launch or when reopening the app. It protects the internal database (`rclone_view.db`), which holds your remotes, job definitions, mount settings, job history, and transfer logs—so sensitive automation stays private even if the workstation is shared.

## What App Lock protects

- Remote definitions and credentials stored in `rclone.conf` (access gated by the app)  
- Transfer history and logs  
- Job settings and schedules  
- Mount configurations and UI state  
- The SQLite database (`rclone_view.db`) that ties everything together

## Who benefits

- Teams sharing one workstation or jump box  
- IT admins running scheduled sync/mount jobs who need tamper resistance  
- Users with sensitive cross-cloud workflows (backups, compliance archives)  
- Anyone who wants a quick security layer without OS-level changes

## How to turn on App Lock (takes a minute)

1) Open **Settings → General Settings** in the top menu.

2) In **General**, check **Enable App Lock**, enter your password, and click **Close**.

That’s it. The next time RcloneView starts or its window is reopened, you’ll see the unlock prompt.

## Resetting when you forget the password

- On the unlock screen, click **Reset App**.  
- Confirm the reset to clear App Lock and all internal data (settings, jobs, transfer history, job history).  
- Your `rclone.conf` remains intact, so remote definitions stay available once you reopen.

## Best practices for secure operations

- Use App Lock on shared PCs or in offices where multiple users can open your session.  
- Pair it with OS account passwords or disk encryption for layered protection.  
- Name jobs clearly but avoid embedding secrets in job names or notes.  
- Back up `rclone_view.db` to a secure, user-writable location (see [change the database location](/support/tutorials/change-rcloneview-database-location)).  
- Keep the scheduler enabled only for jobs you trust and monitor via Job History.

## Quick FAQ

**Does App Lock stop scheduled jobs?**  
No—jobs you’ve scheduled continue to run. App Lock restricts UI access so others can’t view or alter them.

**What if I reset App Lock?**  
Internal data clears, but `rclone.conf` persists, so remotes remain. Recreate jobs/history as needed.

**Can I still use the Terminal?**  
Yes. Once unlocked, the built-in Terminal works normally; App Lock only gates access at launch.

## Wrap-up

A password prompt may seem small, but it’s a powerful shield for remotes, automation, and history. Enable App Lock, keep your `rclone_view.db` in a secure location, and run your cloud workflows knowing they stay private—even on shared machines.
