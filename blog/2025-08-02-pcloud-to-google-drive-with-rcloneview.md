# From pCloud to Google Drive: Plan, Preview & Automate with RcloneView

> Bring your files closer to where your team collaborates. Move content from **pCloud** to **Google Drive** in a clean, point-and-click workflow‚Äîno CLI required.


## Getting the big picture ‚Äî pCloud ‚Üî Google Drive

Many users start with **pCloud** for its straightforward apps and generous file handling, then shift day-to-day collaboration to **Google Drive** for Docs/Sheets/Slides and Workspace features. Consolidating your data helps reduce context-switching and unifies search, sharing, and access controls.

<!-- truncate -->

**Understanding pCloud (at a glance)**  
- Emphasizes large-file handling; pCloud markets **‚Äúunlimited file size‚Äù** uploads with desktop apps.  [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/features/unlimited-capabilities.html)  
- Offers a public API for programmatic access and integrations.  [docs.pcloud.com](https://docs.pcloud.com/)  

**Understanding Google Drive (at a glance)**  
- Deep integration with Google Workspace (Docs/Sheets/Slides) and strong sharing/search.  
- Documented limits to plan around: **up to 5 TB per file** (non-Docs formats) and **750 GB/day per user** upload & copy quota.  [Google Help](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/7338880?hl=en)

### Why move from pCloud to Google Drive?

- **Work where collaboration lives** ‚Äî real-time co-editing & simpler sharing in Google Workspace. 
- **Consolidation** ‚Äî one identity/policy plane across Gmail, Calendar, and Drive.  
- **Operational certainty** ‚Äî plan the cutover around Drive‚Äôs well-documented limits and quotas.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Preparation

Before you begin:

1. **Map the scope** ‚Äî decide which pCloud folders move vs. stay archived.  
2. **Check Drive capacity** ‚Äî make sure your Google account/Workspace has room.  
3. **Mind large files** ‚Äî pCloud handles huge items well; on Drive, plan batches to respect the **750 GB/day** API quota and **5 TB per-file** limit. 
4. **Choose a strategy** ‚Äî one-time migration, staged cutover, or ongoing sync for hybrid workflows.


## Step 2 ‚Äî Connect pCloud & Google Drive in RcloneView

RcloneView wraps **rclone config** in a guided, click-through experience:

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Select **pCloud** ‚Üí follow the browser sign-in/token flow ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyPcloud`)  
   - (Under the hood, rclone‚Äôs pCloud backend walks you through obtaining a token.)  
1. Select **Google Drive** ‚Üí sign in with your Google account ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyGoogleDrive`)  
2. Confirm both remotes appear side-by-side in the Explorer pane

## Step 3 ‚Äî Run the migration (three practical methods)

RcloneView offers three straightforward approaches. Start small, then scale.

### A) Drag & Drop (manual, ad-hoc)
- Open **pCloud** on one side and **Google Drive** on the other, then **drag folders/files across**.  
- Ideal for quick moves and spot checks.

### B) Compare & Copy (preview changes)
- Run **Compare** to see new/changed items before copying; reduce surprises and retries.

### C) Sync & Scheduled Jobs (automate)
- Use **Sync** to mirror selected pCloud folders into Google Drive.  
- **Dry-run** first, then save the task as a reusable **Job**; add a schedule for nightly/weekly runs.

**Pro tips**
- Break very large migrations into batches to respect Drive‚Äôs **750 GB/day** per-user quota.  
- Keep source folders read-only during cutover to prevent drift.  
- If you store native Google Docs on the destination, review rclone‚Äôs import/export notes to avoid unintended conversions. 

## 5) Conclusion ‚Äî Key takeaways & extra tips

- **Why move**: collaborate where your team works (Google Workspace), unify sharing and policy, and simplify daily workflows. 
- **How**: RcloneView connects pCloud & Google Drive and lets you **Drag & Drop**, **Compare**, or **Sync**‚Äîwith **scheduling** for hands-off upkeep.  
- **Plan around limits**: pCloud handles huge files; Drive caps are **5 TB per file** and **750 GB/day upload/copy**‚Äîplan multi-day batches for massive libraries.
