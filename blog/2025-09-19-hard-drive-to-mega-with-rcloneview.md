# Secure Your Hard Drive in the Cloud — Back Up to Mega with RcloneView

> Keep your personal files safe. Use **RcloneView** to upload and synchronize your **hard drive** into **Mega Cloud** without the complexity of CLI.

## Why back up your hard drive to Mega?

- **Hard drives fail**: mechanical damage, accidental deletion, theft  
- **Mega adds**: end-to-end encryption, generous storage, cross-platform access  
- **Result**: a resilient off-site copy you can reach anytime, anywhere

## Step 1 — Preparation

- Pick folders (e.g., Photos, Projects, Documents)  
- Ensure your Mega account has space  
- Plan for one-time uploads vs periodic syncs  


## Step 2 — Connect Hard Drive & Mega in RcloneView

1. Add **Local Remote** → point to your hard drive path  
2. Add **Mega** → login/session → name it `MyMega`  
3. Confirm both appear in Explorer
