# Proton Drive Meets Your Clouds ‚Äî Backup & Sync the Easy Way with RcloneView

> Keep privacy and productivity in the same workflow. Use **RcloneView** to sync and back up files between **Proton Drive** and popular clouds like **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **Amazon S3**‚Äîwithout touching the terminal.

## Why connect Proton Drive with other clouds

Data rarely lives in one place. Teams co-edit in **Google Drive** or **OneDrive**, developers and IT stash archives in **Amazon S3**, and privacy-minded users protect sensitive folders in **Proton Drive**. Bridging these services lets you keep the **right data in the right place**‚Äîwhile avoiding copy-paste chaos.

**Understanding Proton Drive (at a glance)**  
- End-to-end encrypted, privacy-first storage  
- Share links and versioning without giving up control  
- Supported in RcloneView via the Proton backend (browse, copy, sync)

**Understanding collaboration clouds (Google Drive / OneDrive)**  
- Real-time docs and spreadsheet editing  
- Organization-wide sharing and search  
- Ideal for day-to-day teamwork and handoffs

**Understanding object storage (Amazon S3 and compatibles)**  
- Buckets, regions, lifecycle rules, and versioning  
- Cost-efficient for archives, logs, and static assets  
- Excellent for long-term backups and automation

### Quick comparison

| Area | Proton Drive | Google Drive / OneDrive | Amazon S3 (and compatibles) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary strength | Privacy & E2E encryption | Collaboration & Workspace/365 | Durable, scalable object storage |
| Typical use | Sensitive files, private share links | Team projects, co-editing, sharing | Backups/archives, data pipelines |
| RcloneView fit | Secure destination/source | Day-to-day working sets | Long-term off-site copies & lifecycles |

> The sweet spot: **work** in Google Drive or OneDrive, **archive** to S3, and **protect** your most sensitive data in Proton Drive‚Äîcoordinated from one GUI.

## Preparation

Before wiring things up:

- **Define the flow** you want:  
  - Proton ‚áÑ Google Drive (work ‚Üî private)  
  - Proton ‚áÑ OneDrive (work ‚Üî private)  
  - Proton ‚áÑ S3 (private ‚Üî archive)
- **Organize folders** on each side (e.g., `Private/`, `Projects/2025/`, `Exports/`)  
- **Check capacity & quotas** on destinations you‚Äôll push to  
- **Decide cadence**: one-time copy, periodic top-ups, or fully scheduled syncs  
- *(Optional)* **Filtering**: list file types or paths to include/exclude (e.g., exclude `Cache/`, `temp/`)

## Connect remotes in RcloneView

RcloneView wraps rclone‚Äôs configuration in a guided, click-through experience.

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Add **Proton Drive** ‚Üí follow sign-in/token prompts ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyProton`)  
3. Add your counterpart cloud(s):  
   - **Google Drive** ‚Üí OAuth sign-in ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyGoogleDrive`)  
   - **OneDrive** ‚Üí Microsoft OAuth sign-in ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyOneDrive`)  
   - **Amazon S3** (and compatibles) ‚Üí access keys, region, bucket ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyS3`)  
4. Confirm both remotes appear side-by-side in the Explorer pane

## Execute transfers and syncs

RcloneView offers three simple options‚Äîstart with a pilot folder, then scale up.

### Drag & Drop
Browse Proton on one side and your other cloud on the other, then **drag folders/files across**. Perfect for ad-hoc moves or quick deliveries.

### Compare & Copy
Preview differences first‚Äî**new**, **changed**, or **missing** items‚Äîthen copy only what matters. Great for staged migrations and selective updates.  

üëâ See more: [Compare and Manage Files](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents#compare-results-and-manage-files)

### Sync & Scheduled Jobs
Mirror selected folders Proton ‚áÑ Cloud on a schedule‚Äînightly, weekly, or custom CRON-style. Always **dry-run** first, then save as a reusable **Job**.

**Pro tips**  
- **Scope first, then scale**: validate filters and structure with a small subset  
- **Keep sources steady** during large initial moves (make them read-only)  
- **Use include/exclude rules** to skip temp files, caches, or exports  
- **Audit with logs**: RcloneView‚Äôs job history helps you verify every run

## Conclusion ‚Äî what to remember

- **Proton Drive** gives you privacy and encryption; **Google Drive/OneDrive** power collaboration; **S3** excels at durable archives  
- **RcloneView** unifies them in one GUI: **Drag & Drop**, **Compare**, and **Sync & Scheduled Jobs**‚Äîno command line required  
- Start with a **pilot**, respect each service‚Äôs limits/quotas, and **monitor job logs** for a clean, auditable pipeline
