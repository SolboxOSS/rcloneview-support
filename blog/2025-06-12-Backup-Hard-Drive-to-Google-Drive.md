# Easy Backup from Hard Drive to Google Drive with RcloneView

> Protect your important files and ensure access anywhere by backing up your hard drive to Google Drive.


## Ensuring File Safety with Hard Drive Backups to Google Drive

Local hard drives are reliable for daily work but they’re vulnerable: hardware failures, accidental deletion, or theft can cause irreversible data loss. By **backing up your hard drive to Google Drive**, you gain the security of cloud redundancy, remote access, and easy collaboration.

### Understanding Hard Drives
- Fast, local access for personal and work files  
- Vulnerable to crashes, physical damage, or malware  
- Limited redundancy without external backup  

### Understanding Google Drive
- Cloud-based storage accessible from any device  
- Offers ~15 GB free space, expandable with paid tiers  
- Built-in sharing and collaboration with Docs, Sheets, and Slides  

### Why migrate files to Google Drive?
- **Data safety**: A second copy ensures resilience against loss.  
- **Access anywhere**: Work remotely without carrying external drives.  
- **Collaboration**: Share instantly with colleagues or family.  
- **Save space**: Free up local disk capacity while retaining availability.  


## Step 1 – Preparation

Before starting your backup:

1. **Organize local files** to avoid syncing unnecessary data  
2. **Check Google Drive capacity** to ensure enough storage  
3. **Keep a local backup copy** for extra protection  
4. **Decide workflow**: one-time backup vs. ongoing scheduled jobs

## Step 2 – Set Up Connections in RcloneView

1. Open **RcloneView** → click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Select **Google Drive**, complete OAuth login, name it (e.g., `MyGoogleDrive`)  
3. For your **hard drive**, simply choose the **Local** provider and point to a folder path (e.g., `D:\Backups` or `/Users/Name/Documents`)  
4. Both storage sources now appear in Explorer for transfer or sync  


## Step 3 – Running Backup Jobs

RcloneView offers three methods for moving files:

### A) **Drag & Drop**
- Drag files from your hard drive panel to Google Drive  
- Great for quick backups of specific folders  

### B) **Compare & Select**
- Compare differences between local and cloud  
- Transfer only new or updated files  
- Ideal for incremental backups  

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs**
- Sync ensures Google Drive mirrors your hard drive folder  
- Run a **dry-run** before large backups  
- Schedule automatic jobs (e.g., nightly backups at 2 AM)  

**Pro Tips:**  
- Exclude temporary files (`*.tmp`, `.log`) to save space  
- Run first backups in smaller chunks to verify  
- Monitor jobs via the Job Manager dashboard
