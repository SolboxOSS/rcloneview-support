# Seamless Dropbox ‚Üí OneDrive Migration & Sync with RcloneView

> Consolidate your storage and simplify collaboration by moving data from **Dropbox** to **OneDrive**‚Äîall inside a clean, point-and-click interface.


## Introduction ‚Äî When a Dropbox ‚Üí OneDrive move makes sense

Teams and individuals often start in **Dropbox** for its simplicity and cross-platform sync, then adopt **Microsoft 365** and **OneDrive** for tighter Office/Teams integration and centralized IT management. Moving content between them helps you keep projects in one place, reduce context-switching, and standardize permissions and governance.

**Understanding Dropbox (at a glance)**  
- Built for fast, reliable sync and broad app integrations.  
- Large object support depends on how you upload (web vs. app). Dropbox‚Äôs help docs note web uploads up to **350‚Äì375 GB** per item and **up to 2 TB** via the desktop app.  [Dropbox Help Center](https://help.dropbox.com/create-upload/add-files)

**Understanding OneDrive (at a glance)**  
- Deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 (Word/Excel/PowerPoint, Teams) and enterprise controls.  
- Microsoft documents a **250 GB** per-file limit and various operational limits for downloads/sync.  [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa)

## Step 1 ‚Äî Preparation

Before you begin:

1. **Map the scope** ‚Äì decide which folders move vs. stay archived.  
2. **Check storage headroom** ‚Äì confirm you have enough OneDrive capacity.  
3. **Mind large files** ‚Äì plan for items near size limits (see table above). 
4. **Choose a strategy** ‚Äì one-time migration, staged moves, or ongoing sync.


## Step 2 ‚Äî Connect Dropbox & OneDrive in RcloneView

RcloneView wraps **rclone config** in a friendly workflow:

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Choose **Dropbox** and complete OAuth sign-in, then name it (e.g., `MyDropbox`)  
3. Add **OneDrive**, sign in with your Microsoft account/tenant, name it (e.g., `MyOneDrive`)  
4. Confirm both remotes appear in the Explorer pane (left/right)

## Step 3 ‚Äî Execute the transfer

RcloneView gives you three straightforward approaches. Start small, then scale.

### A) Drag & Drop (manual, ad-hoc)
- Browse Dropbox on one side and OneDrive on the other, then **drag folders/files across**.  
- Ideal for quick moves and sanity checks.

### B) Compare & Copy (preview changes)
- Run **Compare** to spot new/changed items before copying.  
- Reduce surprises and avoid duplicates.

### C) Sync & Scheduled Jobs (automate)
- Use **Sync** to mirror selected Dropbox folders into OneDrive.  
- **Dry-run** first, then save as a reusable job; add a schedule for nightly or weekly runs.

- Break very large migrations into batches; respect provider limits and quotas.  
- Keep source content read-only during the cutover window to prevent drift.
