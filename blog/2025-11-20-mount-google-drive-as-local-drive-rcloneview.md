# Mount Google Drive as a Local Drive on Windows & macOS with RcloneView

> 40K+ people a month search for "mount Google Drive". RcloneView turns that CLI-heavy answer into a two-click workflow with caching, auto-start, and GUI monitoring.

`rclone mount` is legendary but intimidating: OAuth tokens, config passwords, WinFsp/macFUSE installs, long flag strings, and scripts to relaunch after reboot. RcloneView bundles those pieces into a desktop app so you can mount Google Drive (and any other cloud) as a real drive letter on Windows or a Finder volume on macOS, no terminal required.

## Why Choose RcloneView Over DIY CLI Mounts

- **Guided OAuth**: Remote Manager launches a secure browser, stores refresh tokens(see [Remote Manager](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager)).
- **Driver helpers**: WinFsp and macFUSE prompts are embedded inside the installer, and RcloneView validates them before you hit Mount.
- **Repeatable templates**: Mount Manager remembers every Google Drive, Shared Drive, or other remote so you can remount after reboots with a toggle.
- **Multi-cloud control**: While you mount Google Drive, you can also sync to Dropbox, compare S3 buckets, or schedule jobs from the same UI.
- **Monitoring & scheduler**: Built-in Scheduler and transfer monitors show throughput and restart mounts automatically if you choose.

## Step 1 -- Prep Your Desktop

1. **Install RcloneView** (bundle includes rclone). On Windows, accept the WinFsp prompt; on macOS, install macFUSE.
2. **Name your external drive letters or Finder volumes** where you want Google Drive to appear (for example `G:` or `/Volumes/GDrive`).
3. **Decide caching space**: pick an SSD folder with at least a few GB free; you will point mounts to it later for faster previews.

## Step 2 -- Connect Google Drive (and Friends)

- Open Remote Manager and click **Add Remote** -> **Google Drive**. Follow the OAuth prompts described in [Add OAuth Online Login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login#auto-login-onedrive-box-).
- Label the remote `gdrive-main` (and optionally add Shared Drives or other clouds like Dropbox, OneDrive, or S3 so you can compare/sync later).
- Use [Browse and manage remote storage](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage) to create folder presets you will mount frequently (Design, Finance, Shared Drives, etc.).

## Step 3 -- Mount Google Drive from Explorer or Mount Manager

1. Launch the dual-pane Explorer, select your Google Drive remote, and click the **Mount icon** in the toolbar.
2. Choose **Drive Letter/Volume**, pick your cache path, and toggle read/write, cache mode, and bandwidth caps.
3. Hit **Mount**, then open File Explorer or Finder to see the new drive.

Mount Manager (Tools -> Mount Manager) keeps a list of mounts with auto-start, reconnect, and launch-at-login switches. You can even expose multiple Google accounts simultaneously, a trick that usually requires several command shells.


## Step 4 -- Automate Workflows Beyond Mounting

Mounting is step one. RcloneView layers multi-cloud workflows on top of it:

- **Compare and clean up** Google Drive vs. a local SSD or Dropbox using [Compare folder contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents) while the mount stays live.  

  <img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-display-select.png" alt="Compare shared folder and My Drive contents" class="img-large img-center" />
  

- **Sync or copy** entire folders to external drives using [Create sync jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs) and [Synchronize remote storages](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages) for offline backups.  

  <img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/job-run-click.png" alt="Running an encrypted sync job in RcloneView" class="img-large img-center" />
  

- **Schedule** those jobs so every night your mounted Google Drive enqueues a Sync to NAS or Wasabi without manual clicks (see [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution)).

- **Mount other clouds** side-by-side (OneDrive, Dropbox, S3) and drag files between Finder windows like they are local disks.

## Use Cases RcloneView Unlocks

- **Designers & media teams**: Stream assets straight into Adobe or DaVinci Resolve without storing the entire library locally.
- **Developers & DevOps**: Mount Shared Drives for configuration files, then script Compare or Sync jobs to stage/production buckets.
- **Audit & compliance**: Mount Google Drive read-only for reviewers while the Scheduler keeps immutable copies landing in S3 or external drives.
- **Power users**: Replace Drive for Desktop with a lighter mount that obeys your own cache paths, bandwidth caps, and logging.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Do I still need the CLI?**  
No. RcloneView generates all `rclone mount` flags behind the scenes. Advanced users can open the job details to see the exact command.

**What about macOS permissions?**  
Approve System Extension prompts for macFUSE, then revisit Mount Manager if Finder cannot see the volume. The how-to guide includes screenshots for granting permissions.

**Can I mount multiple Google accounts?**  
Yes. Add one remote per account in Remote Manager, then create a mount entry for each. RcloneView keeps tokens separate so you can view `gdrive-marketing` and `gdrive-personal` simultaneously.

Mounting Google Drive is still a top Google Search because the CLI answers are complex. RcloneView gives those 40K+ searchers a no-code path: connect your Google account once, hit Mount, and get a dependable drive letter or Finder volume with all the multi-cloud power (Compare, Sync, Scheduler) you already rely on. Download the latest build and retire your mount scripts today.
