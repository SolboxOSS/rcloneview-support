# Encrypt, Sync, and Protect MEGA Files with RcloneView — GUI for rclone MEGA Users

> MEGA already offers end-to-end encryption, but pairing it with rclone Crypt and RcloneView's GUI unlocks double protection plus hands-free backups.

Keyword research keeps pointing to a single pain point for MEGA users:
- `mega encryption` → 22K+ monthly searches
- `secure mega storage` → 15K+ monthly searches
- `rclone mega` → 9K+ monthly searches

Security-minded teams want a GUI-driven way to stack encryption, schedule backups, and keep MEGA data synced everywhere without touching the command line. This article shows how to wrap MEGA remotes with rclone Crypt, operate them through RcloneView, and automate multi-cloud copies so you can sleep on stronger defenses.

## Why MEGA power users layer encryption and automation

MEGA's native end-to-end encryption is great for casual use, yet regulated teams often keep sensitive files in more than one cloud and demand tamper-evident logs. RcloneView adds those guardrails:

| Challenge | Manual browser workflow | RcloneView + rclone Crypt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Additional encryption | Limited to MEGA's defaults | Wrap any remote (MEGA, S3, Drive) in Crypt for per-file obfuscation |
| Multi-cloud sync | Download → unzip → re-upload | Direct cloud-to-cloud copy governed by Scheduler |
| Key management | Scattered text files | Stored inside encrypted rclone config with optional config password |
| Validation | Hope the download finished | Compare view, checksum-first sync, job history logs |

Unlike ad-hoc exports, RcloneView keeps every transfer auditable with timestamps, per-file stats, and resumable retries—ideal for engineers and IT admins who must prove encryption coverage.

## Prerequisites (5 minutes)

1. [Download RcloneView](https://rcloneview.com/src/download.html) for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. Add MEGA via **`+ New Remote`** following the [MEGA connection guide](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/mega). Bring either a session ID or email/password with 2FA.
3. (Optional) Add a destination cloud such as Google Drive, S3, Wasabi, or a local NAS using the same wizard.
4. In **Settings → General**, enable **Config Password** if you want the rclone configuration itself encrypted (see `howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings.md`).



## Step 1 — Wrap MEGA with rclone Crypt inside RcloneView

Rclone Crypt gives you filename and content encryption on top of whatever the upstream cloud already does. You can build it entirely in the GUI:

1. Open **Explorer → + New Remote**.
2. Choose **Crypt (Encrypted Storage)** as the remote type. Refer to the Crypt how-to if you need screenshots.
3. When prompted for **Remote (folder to encrypt)**, pick the MEGA remote you created earlier (e.g., `mega-prod:`) and select the folder to protect.
4. Set a Crypt remote name such as `mega-crypt:` and enter the passphrase. RcloneView can store it in the encrypted config so you do not retype each launch.

Now, the Explorer shows two entries:
- `mega-prod:` (plain MEGA remote for legacy workflows)
- `mega-crypt:` (wrapped Crypt remote)

Always browse and schedule jobs against the Crypt remote so data is encrypted before leaving your workstation.

## Step 2 — Design encrypted sync and backup workflows

With `mega-crypt:` ready, you can work visually without CLI memorization.

### Compare and preview

1. Split Explorer so the left pane shows `mega-crypt:` and the right pane shows the target (e.g., `gdrive-vault:` or a local NAS).
2. Click **Compare** to preview deltas. If you have a Plus license, use the **Filter** icon to hide cache/temp folders. The [Compare folders guide](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents) covers include/exclude logic.
3. Review the Compare results and filters before running copy or sync so filenames, sizes, and timestamps match expectations.

### Save as a reusable Job

1. Highlight the source/destination, then right-click → **Sync** (for mirroring) or **Copy** (for append-only backups).
2. Configure key options in the wizard:
   - **Advanced Settings**: set number of file transfers, multi-threaded transfers, and enable checksum comparison.
   - **Filtering Settings**: limit by size, age, or depth, and add predefined or custom filters to skip cache/temp folders.
   - **Create empty directories** if you want blank source folders mirrored on the destination.
3. Give the job a descriptive name such as `Mega-Encrypted-to-Drive-Nightly`.

## Step 3 — Automate with the Scheduler

The Scheduler (Plus license) lives on **Step 4: Scheduling** of the Job wizard:

1. Check **Run whenever time units ~** to enable a schedule and set minute/hour/day fields (crontab-style).
2. Use **Simulate** to preview upcoming runs.
3. Save the job. Make sure **Launch at login** is enabled in Settings if you want scheduled jobs to resume after reboot.

## Step 4 — Monitor, verify, and recover

- **Job History**: shows every Scheduler run with timestamps, bytes, exit codes, and log links. Export logs for compliance.
- **Transfer panel**: real-time bandwidth, throughput, and per-file visibility eliminate blind spots common with manual downloads.
- **Compare after automation**: rerun Compare to confirm zero deltas or intentionally skipped folders.
- **Resume & retries**: if MEGA or the destination throttles, rerun the saved job; history shows previous outcomes.

## Hardening checklist for MEGA + Crypt deployments

- Protect the rclone config with a password (Settings → General) so secrets stay encrypted at rest.
- Store Crypt passphrases in a hardware security module or password manager; never paste them into chat apps.
- Pair Copy jobs (MEGA → Drive) with periodic Sync jobs back to MEGA if you also need disaster recovery for collaborative folders.
- Keep RcloneView up to date; releases often include new rclone flags, Crypt improvements, and security patches.

## Real-world blueprints

| Team | Requirement | RcloneView solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Game studio | Keep MEGA raw assets encrypted while allowing Drive previews | Use `mega-crypt:` → Drive Copy jobs nightly, share Drive as read-only |
| Healthcare research | Need immutable encrypted archives off-site | Copy `mega-crypt:/IRB` to S3/Glacier with versioned folders and lifecycle rules |
| MSPs managing clients | Centralize multiple MEGA accounts securely | Create per-client Crypt remotes, store passphrases in encrypted config, schedule staggered jobs |
| Security teams | Demonstrate encryption + backup policy compliance | Export Scheduler history weekly, attach to audit reports |

## FAQ for MEGA security automation

**Do I lose MEGA's E2EE if I use Crypt?**  
No. Crypt encrypts locally before files leave your machine, so MEGA still stores ciphertext. You effectively add another envelope.

**Can I decrypt files elsewhere?**  
Yes. Import the same `rclone.conf` into any machine and use the Crypt remote to decrypt. Guard the passphrases carefully.

**What if MEGA throttles API calls?**  
Lower transfer concurrency in Advanced Settings and schedule off-peak hours. If a run fails, rerun the saved job from Job Manager.

**Is there a way to verify nothing changed?**  
Run Compare, enable checksum syncs, and review Job History. Everything is timestamped so you can prove integrity.

## Take the next step

RcloneView gives MEGA power users a GUI-native way to combine rclone Crypt, Scheduler, Compare, and logging. Instead of juggling CLIs or downloading archives, you can encrypt once, automate forever, and keep every action auditable.
