# RcloneView + iCloud Drive: Secure Apple Cloud Backups with Built-In Terminal

> iCloud Drive is popular, but enterprise-grade backup workflows are not built in. RcloneView bridges the gap by letting you add iCloud via the built-in Terminal, then manage everything visually with Compare, Sync, and Jobs.

If you want a reliable way to back up iCloud Drive to Google Drive, S3, or a local disk, you need two things: **rclone's iCloud backend** and **a GUI for safe, repeatable workflows**. RcloneView delivers both in one place.

## Why iCloud backups are tricky

- iCloud requires interactive Apple ID login and 2FA.
- Native tools lack cross-cloud backup or scheduling.
- CLI-only setups are powerful but easy to misconfigure.

RcloneView solves this by letting you run the required CLI steps in its built-in Terminal, then manage everything in the GUI afterward.

## Step 1: Open the RcloneView Terminal

Use the built-in Terminal to run rclone commands without opening an external shell.

## Step 2: Add iCloud Drive using rclone config

iCloud currently requires CLI configuration due to Apple 2FA. Run `rclone config` inside the Terminal and follow the prompts:

```bash
rclone config
```

Key prompts you will see:

- **Storage**: select `iclouddrive` (or its number)
- **Apple ID**: your iCloud email
- **Password**: your Apple ID password
- **2FA code**: enter the code sent to your trusted device

## Step 3: Confirm the new remote in RcloneView

Once the remote is created, it appears in **Remote Manager** automatically.

From here, you can open it in Explorer and use the normal GUI workflow.

## Step 4: Use GUI tools for safe backups

### Compare before you Sync

Run **Compare** to see what will change before a sync touches your data.

### Sync iCloud to another cloud

Select iCloud as the source and your backup target (Drive, S3, external disk) as destination.

### Save as a Job and schedule it

Save the Sync as a Job for recurring backups (Plus license).

## Best practices for iCloud backups

- **Use a dedicated destination folder** to keep backups organized.
- **Start with a dry run** to validate the sync direction.
- **Keep Apple ID 2FA ready** during initial setup.
- **Monitor Job History** to detect failures early.

## Who this workflow is for

- **Beginners** who want a visual safety net.
- **Engineers** who need CLI flexibility but prefer GUI operations.
- **IT admins** who want repeatable, auditable backup jobs.

## Conclusion

iCloud Drive can be backed up safely and repeatedly when you combine rclone CLI with a visual control layer. Use the RcloneView Terminal once to set up iCloud, then run everything else in the GUI for speed, safety, and clarity.
