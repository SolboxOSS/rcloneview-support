# Dropbox ‚Üí Google Drive, Simplified: Transfer, Sync & Schedule with RcloneView

> Bring your files closer to where your team collaborates. Move content from **Dropbox** to **Google Drive** in a clean, point-and-click workflow‚Äîno CLI required.


## Introduction ‚Äî Why consolidate from Dropbox to Google Drive?

Many teams begin in **Dropbox** for its quick, reliable sync and broad integrations. Over time, they adopt **Google Drive** to take advantage of Google Docs/Sheets/Slides and Workspace collaboration, sharing, and search. Consolidating into Google Drive reduces context-switching and gives you unified permissions and governance.

**Understanding Dropbox (at a glance)**  
- Fast, dependable sync across devices; wide app ecosystem.  
- File size limits vary by upload method (web vs. desktop app). Dropbox states **up to 375 GB** via the website and **up to 2 TB** per item via the desktop app.  [Dropbox Help Center](https://help.dropbox.com/sync/upload-limitations)

**Understanding Google Drive (at a glance)**  
- Deep Workspace integration (Docs/Sheets/Slides), powerful sharing and search.  
- Google documents a **maximum file size of 5 TB** (non-Docs formats), and Drive‚Äôs API imposes **750 GB/day** upload & copy quota per user. Plan large moves accordingly.

## Step 1 ‚Äî Preparation

Before you begin:

1. **Map the scope** ‚Äî decide which folders move vs. remain archived.  
2. **Check Drive capacity** ‚Äî ensure enough storage in your Google account/Workspace.  
3. **Mind large files** ‚Äî plan for items nearing Dropbox‚Äôs per-item limits and Drive‚Äôs daily 750 GB API quota.
4. **Choose the strategy** ‚Äî one-time migration, staged cutover, or ongoing sync for hybrid workflows.


## Step 2 ‚Äî Connect Dropbox & Google Drive in RcloneView

RcloneView wraps **rclone config** in a guided, click-through experience:

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**  
2. Choose **Dropbox** ‚Üí complete OAuth sign-in ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyDropbox`)  
3. Choose **Google Drive** ‚Üí sign in with your Google account ‚Üí name it (e.g., `MyGoogleDrive`)  
4. Confirm both remotes appear side-by-side in the Explorer pane

üîç Helpful guides:  
- **Auto Login (Google Drive, Dropbox)** ‚Äî quick setup with OAuth in RcloneView.  [RcloneView](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login)  
- **Add & Manage Remotes** ‚Äî where to find the **New Remote** dialog and Remote Manager.  [RcloneView](https://rcloneview.com/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager/)

## Step 3 ‚Äî Execute the transfer

RcloneView offers three straightforward approaches. Start small, then scale.

### A) Drag & Drop (manual, ad-hoc)
- Open Dropbox on one side and Google Drive on the other, then **drag folders/files across**.  
- Ideal for quick moves and spot checks.

### B) Compare & Copy (preview changes)
- Run **Compare** to see new/changed items before copying; reduce surprises and retries.

### C) Sync & Scheduled Jobs (automate)
- Use **Sync** to mirror selected Dropbox folders into Google Drive.  
- **Dry-run** first, then save the task as a reusable **Job**; add a schedule for nightly/weekly runs.

**Pro tips**
- Break very large migrations into batches; respect **per-item** and **per-day** limits to avoid interruptions.   
- Keep source folders read-only during cutover to prevent drift.  
- Need share links? rclone supports generating public links on supported backends (advanced).
