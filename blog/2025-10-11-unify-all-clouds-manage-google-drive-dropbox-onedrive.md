# Unify All Clouds: Manage Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive in One App

> Stop juggling tabs and logins. With **RcloneView**, you can connect **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, and **OneDrive** into one simple, powerful desktop app—preview, sync, and organize all your files visually, without touching the command line.

## Why unify your cloud drives?

Most professionals today store files across multiple platforms—team docs in Google Drive, shared folders in Dropbox, and personal files in OneDrive. Switching between tabs or apps breaks focus and makes data management cumbersome.

RcloneView brings these clouds together into **one pane of glass**, giving you total visibility and control over your files—regardless of where they live.

## Step 1 — Preparation

Before connecting your clouds:

1. **Review your accounts:** note which services you want to connect (e.g., personal Google Drive, business OneDrive).  
2. **Clean up folder structures:** tidy up before merging views—avoid duplicates.  
3. **Plan sync flows:** decide which clouds need to share data (e.g., Dropbox → Google Drive).  
4. **Check quotas:** ensure enough space for transfers or sync jobs.  
5. *(Optional)* **Filter or exclude folders** you don’t need in sync (e.g., cache or temporary folders).

## Step 2 — Connect your cloud drives in RcloneView

RcloneView turns rclone’s setup into a clean, guided flow.

1. Open **RcloneView** → click **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Choose your cloud type (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive).  
3. Complete the sign-in prompts and name each remote (e.g., `MyDrive`, `MyDropbox`, `WorkOneDrive`).  
4. Confirm that all three appear in the Explorer pane.  

You’ll now see each connected cloud side-by-side, ready for browsing, comparison, or transfers.

## Step 3 — Transfer and sync between drives

RcloneView provides three intuitive ways to move or sync data.

### A) **Drag & Drop (Manual Transfers)**  
Browse your Google Drive on one side and Dropbox or OneDrive on the other.  
Simply **drag and drop** files or folders to copy instantly.

### B) **Compare & Copy (Selective Sync)**  
Use **Compare** to preview what’s new, changed, or missing between drives.  
Copy only what’s updated to save bandwidth and time.

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs (Automation)**  
Use **Sync** to automatically mirror your Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive folders.  
Set it to run nightly or weekly for hands-off consistency.  
Always **dry-run** first to confirm expected actions.

- **Dry-run often** to preview actions before syncing real data.  
- **Monitor history logs** — every job in RcloneView is fully traceable.  
- **Mix and match** — connect more providers like S3, pCloud, or Mega anytime.
