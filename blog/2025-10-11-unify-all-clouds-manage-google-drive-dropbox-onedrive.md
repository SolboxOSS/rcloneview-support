# Unify All Clouds: Manage Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive in One App

> Stop juggling tabs and logins. With **RcloneView**, you can connect **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, and **OneDrive** into one simple, powerful desktop appâ€”preview, sync, and organize all your files visually, without touching the command line.

## Why unify your cloud drives?

Most professionals today store files across multiple platformsâ€”team docs in Google Drive, shared folders in Dropbox, and personal files in OneDrive. Switching between tabs or apps breaks focus and makes data management cumbersome.

RcloneView brings these clouds together into **one pane of glass**, giving you total visibility and control over your filesâ€”regardless of where they live.

## Step 1 â€” Preparation

Before connecting your clouds:

1. **Review your accounts:** note which services you want to connect (e.g., personal Google Drive, business OneDrive).  
2. **Clean up folder structures:** tidy up before merging viewsâ€”avoid duplicates.  
3. **Plan sync flows:** decide which clouds need to share data (e.g., Dropbox â†’ Google Drive).  
4. **Check quotas:** ensure enough space for transfers or sync jobs.  
5. *(Optional)* **Filter or exclude folders** you donâ€™t need in sync (e.g., cache or temporary folders).

## Step 2 â€” Connect your cloud drives in RcloneView

RcloneView turns rcloneâ€™s setup into a clean, guided flow.

1. Open **RcloneView** â†’ click **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Choose your cloud type (Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive).  
3. Complete the sign-in prompts and name each remote (e.g., `MyDrive`, `MyDropbox`, `WorkOneDrive`).  
4. Confirm that all three appear in the Explorer pane.  

Youâ€™ll now see each connected cloud side-by-side, ready for browsing, comparison, or transfers.

## Step 3 â€” Transfer and sync between drives

RcloneView provides three intuitive ways to move or sync data.

Simply **drag and drop** files or folders to copy instantly.

### B) **Compare & Copy (Selective Sync)**

### C) **Sync & Scheduled Jobs (Automation)**
