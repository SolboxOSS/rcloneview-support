# Automate Daily Cloud Backups with RcloneView Scheduler

> Reliable backups only matter when they run every day. RcloneView’s scheduler makes it effortless.

Manual cloud backups rarely happen on time—someone forgets, a laptop is asleep, or a cron task silently fails. Meanwhile, ransomware, accidental deletions, or a lost laptop can wipe out weeks of work. Whether you’re protecting family photos on Google Drive, engineering assets on OneDrive, Dropbox collaboration folders, or archives in S3/Wasabi/R2, you need a consistent daily run. RcloneView layers a friendly GUI over rclone’s proven engine, so you can design backup jobs and let the scheduler fire automatically without touching scripts.

**Typical workflows**

- Local PC ➜ Google Drive or OneDrive
- NAS ➜ Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, or S3 for off-site copies
- Cloud-to-cloud (Drive ➜ Dropbox, OneDrive ➜ S3) for redundancy

Automation keeps those flows consistent:

```
[Local / NAS / Cloud A] --(RcloneView scheduled Sync)--> [Cloud Backup B]
```

## Understanding Cloud Backup Automation

Automation means your backup job runs whether or not you remember. Rclone (CLI) already supports this, and RcloneView brings it into a guided wizard with previews, filters, and scheduling built in.

| Backup type      | Description                                        | Example use case                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| One-way backup   | Copy source to destination, source remains primary | NAS → Google Drive nightly snapshot   |
| Sync (mirror)    | Keep two locations identical                       | Project folder ↔ OneDrive team share  |
| Versioned backup | Retain previous versions or dated folders          | Designers storing daily doc revisions |

RcloneView supports all three, and the scheduler can trigger them daily, hourly, or weekly. No cron, Task Scheduler, or shell scripts needed.

## Why Automate Backups with RcloneView?

- Visual job builder—pick source/destination clouds via Explorer, then save as a job.
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with the same job definition.
- Supports any rclone backend: Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, FTP/SFTP, local disks, and more.
- Scheduler highlights:
  - Daily/hourly/weekly cadence plus cron-style patterns
  - Optional retries on failure
  - Dry-run previews before enabling automation
  - Job history showing last/next run and logs
  - Multiple jobs can run concurrently with separate schedules

## Step-by-Step — Automate Daily Cloud Backups

### Step 1 — Connect your remotes

Add the services you plan to use (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, S3/Wasabi/R2, NAS via SFTP, external drives, etc.). Use `+ New Remote` and follow the provider wizard.

### Step 2 — Create a backup or sync job

Open **Job Manager** → **Add Job**. Select source and destination folders. Choose job type (Copy, Sync, Move) depending on your desired behavior.

### Step 3 — Configure preferences

- Filters to exclude `*.tmp`, `node_modules/`, cache folders, etc.
- Versioning rules (copy into date-stamped subfolders) if you want history.
- Throttle bandwidth or set transfer threads for busy networks.

### Step 4 — Enable the scheduler

In Step 4 of the job wizard, toggle scheduling, choose **Daily**, and set a time (e.g., 03:00). Add retries (e.g., 3 attempts) for resilience.

### Step 5 — Dry run

Use the **Dry run / Simulate** option to preview which files will transfer. Confirm the delta looks correct before letting it run unattended.


### Step 6 — Save and monitor

Save the job. RcloneView runs it automatically each day while the app is running (enable “Launch at login” in Settings for hands-free operation). Review logs and history in Job Manager to confirm success or investigate failures.

## Advanced Settings for Power Users

- **Incremental vs. full**: Schedule daily incremental syncs plus a weekly full copy to a date-stamped folder.
- **Provider optimizations**:
  - Google Drive—respect the 750 GB/day upload cap; schedule off-peak hours.
  - Dropbox—enable delta detection to minimize API usage.
  - S3/Wasabi/R2—pick regions near your NAS for lower latency.
- **Hybrid schedules**: Run a local-to-cloud job daily at 3 AM, then a cloud-to-cloud replication every Sunday for disaster recovery.
- **Retention policies**: Pair scheduled jobs with versioned folders or lifecycle rules (S3/Wasabi) to prune older copies automatically.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem                      | Likely cause                 | Fix                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backup fails mid-run         | API rate limit or throttling | Reduce concurrency, add retries, schedule during quieter hours         |
| Slow throughput              | Bandwidth cap enabled        | Adjust or disable bandwidth limit in job settings                      |
| Files missing in destination | Overly aggressive filters    | Review include/exclude list; test with Dry run                         |
| Schedules stop after reboot  | App not running              | Enable “Launch at login” so RcloneView + scheduler start automatically |

## Zero-Maintenance Backups

Daily backups shouldn’t require scripts or babysitting. With RcloneView, you create jobs visually, preview them, and turn on the scheduler so every cloud-to-cloud or local-to-cloud transfer runs on autopilot. Whether you manage family archives or corporate assets, automation keeps data safe and frees you from manual routines.
