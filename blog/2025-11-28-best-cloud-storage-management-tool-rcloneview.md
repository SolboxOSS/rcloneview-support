# Best Cloud Storage Management Tool: Why RcloneView is the Ultimate Multi-Cloud Explorer

> Stop juggling multiple clients. RcloneView wraps rclone’s 100+ providers in a fast, two-pane Explorer with Compare, bulk copy, scheduling, and rich logging.

## 100+ remotes in one place

- **Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, Mega** with OAuth logins.
- **S3-compatible** (AWS S3, Wasabi, R2, B2), **WebDAV**, **SFTP/SMB**, **NAS/external drives**.
- No separate plugins or adapters; add via **Remote → + New Remote** and sign in.
- Reuse saved remotes across Explorer, Compare, Sync, and Jobs.

## Two-pane Explorer productivity

- Side-by-side panes reduce tab hopping vs. single-pane tools.
- Drag and drop between remotes; progress shows in **Transfer**.
- Context actions (Copy → / ← Copy, Delete) stay consistent across providers.

## Compare: quick difference analysis

- Highlight new, changed, and matching files before copying.
- Prevents accidental overwrites; great for incremental updates.
- Launch Compare from the toolbar in Browse, then copy selectively.

## Fast, resilient transfers

- Multi-threaded uploads/downloads with retries and resumable support.
- Bandwidth limits and concurrency controls tame throttling.
- Checksum verification (where supported) for data integrity.
- Real-time logs beat blind progress bars in legacy clients.

## Why GUI over rclone CLI?

- Same rclone engine, but guided UI—no flag memorization.
- Profiles and Jobs remove per-command setup.
- Visual previews (Compare, Sync) reduce mistakes.
- Easier onboarding for teammates who avoid terminals.

## Quick transfer demo (Cloud → Cloud)

1. Add two remotes (e.g., Google Drive and S3) via **Remote → + New Remote**.
2. Open **Browse**; load Google Drive in the left pane, S3 in the right.
3. Click **Compare** to see differences, or drag files across to start copy.
4. Watch **Transfer** for throughput and retries; pause/resume as needed.
5. Save the workflow as a **Job** to reuse later.

👉 Sync options: [Synchronize Remote Storages](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages)

## Schedule and automate

- Open **Job Manager → Add Job**, pick a saved job, and set a daily or hourly schedule.
- Chain jobs (e.g., Drive → S3 at 02:00, S3 → NAS at 03:00) to avoid contention.
- Review history/logs to confirm success and rerun failed batches only.

## Takeaways vs. Cyberduck/WinSCP

- Broader provider coverage (100+ vs. smaller lists).
- Two-pane layout with Compare and Sync previews (not just copy/paste).
- Built-in scheduler and Jobs; no external cron required.
- Rich logging with retry insight vs. opaque progress bars.
- GUI on top of rclone’s proven engine for speed and stability.

## Summary

RcloneView is a multi-cloud Explorer that outperforms traditional clients: add 100+ remotes, compare before copying, move data faster, and automate backups or migrations—all with a friendly GUI over rclone. Try it once and retire the tab-hopping workflow.
