## Why use RcloneView for multi-cloud transfers?

- Secure OAuth for Google Drive plus simple email/password for pCloud; no tokens to paste.
- Multi-threaded, resumable uploads with progress logs and retries.
- Two-pane Explorer for direct drag-and-drop between clouds.
- Compare to preview differences before copying or cleaning up.
- Sync with include/exclude filters, dry-run, and size-based decisions.
- Background Jobs and scheduling to automate recurring moves.

RcloneView combines rclone’s reliability with a visual workflow so teams and admins can move large folders confidently.

## Before you start

- Sign in to both accounts and confirm quota and API limits (Google Drive enforces a 750 GB/day upload cap per user).
- Install the latest RcloneView build: [Download](https://rcloneview.com/src/download.html).
- For pCloud, ensure you have your email/password handy; enable app passwords if your security settings require them.
- Prefer wired or stable Wi-Fi during large transfers and keep RcloneView running for uninterrupted jobs.

## Step 1: Connect your cloud remotes

1. Open **Remote → + New Remote**.
2. Select **pCloud** and enter your **email** and **password**, then save.
3. Repeat for **Google Drive**, clicking **Connect** to finish the OAuth browser login.
4. Confirm both remotes appear in Remote Manager.

## Four methods for pCloud ↔ Google Drive transfers

### Method 1: Drag & drop between panes

1. Select files or folders in the pCloud pane.
2. Drag them into the Google Drive pane (or the other way around).
3. Watch progress in the **Transfer** tab; pause or resume if needed.

### Method 2: Compare, then copy or delete

1. Open the source folder on the left and destination on the right.
2. Click **Compare** on the toolbar.
3. RcloneView highlights unique items, size differences, and matches.
4. Select what to move, then choose **Copy →** or **← Copy**.
5. Use **Delete** carefully to clean up duplicates or stale data.

### Method 3: Sync or save as a Job

1. Select your pCloud source and Google Drive destination.
2. Click **Sync** and choose one-way or two-way sync.
3. Preview changes, adjust filters (include/exclude), then start.
4. Click **Save to Jobs** to reuse the same configuration later.

### Method 4: Schedule recurring sync jobs

1. Open **Job Manager → Add Job**.
2. Set **pCloud** as the source and **Google Drive** as the destination (or reverse).
3. Choose a schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, or custom cron-like).
4. Enable the job and let RcloneView run it automatically.
5. Check logs and history to verify successful runs.

## Tips for smooth transfers

- Run **dry-run** before large syncs to confirm the plan.
- Use **bandwidth limits** during work hours to reduce throttling risk.
- For encrypted pCloud folders, ensure you have access keys or decrypt locally before moving.
- When approaching Google Drive’s daily cap, split jobs across days or accounts.
- Keep the **Transfer** tab open to monitor retries, speeds, and any API responses.

## Summary

RcloneView delivers fast, reliable, no-CLI transfers between **pCloud** and **Google Drive**. With side-by-side browsing, Compare, Sync, reusable Jobs, and scheduling, you can handle migrations or recurring backups without manual downloads or re-uploads.
