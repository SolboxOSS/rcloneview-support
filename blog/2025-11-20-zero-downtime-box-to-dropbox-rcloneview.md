# Zero-Downtime Box to Dropbox Compliance Migration with RcloneView

> Seed, verify, and cut over entire Box Business libraries without telling users to log off.

Box powers marketing approvals, legal review rooms, and agency workflows, but many teams want Dropbox Business for Smart Sync, external collaboration, or simpler quota control. Pausing every project to run exports is not an option. RcloneView layers a friendly GUI on top of rclone so you can register Box and Dropbox remotes, compare folders, schedule copy jobs, and mount destinations for QA while auditors watch the logs.

## Why Box Teams Need Zero-Downtime Migrations

- **Regulatory pressure**: Contract and finance folders must remain accessible and retainable during the move, so you need immutable logs and recoverable rollback paths.
- **API guardrails**: Box and Dropbox both enforce request limits; a scheduler-driven approach avoids throttling spikes and keeps deltas predictable.
- **Hybrid reality**: Agencies often keep some live folders in Box while Dropbox receives archives or shared workspaces, so coexistence for a few weeks is normal.

RcloneView addresses all of it with Remote Manager, the dual-pane Explorer, Compare previews, Sync jobs, Mount Manager, and an internal scheduler.

## RcloneView Migration Blueprint

1. **Connect** Box and Dropbox inside [Remote Manager](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager) using the OAuth wizard documented in [Add OAuth Online Login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login#auto-login-onedrive-box-) for Box and Dropbox.
2. **Organize** remotes with color labels and scoped root paths so each job only touches a single Box library or Dropbox team folder. See [Browse and manage remote storage](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage).
3. **Template** Copy/Sync jobs via [Create sync jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs) and [Synchronize remote storages](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages), then preview changes with [Compare folder contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents).
4. **Automate** deltas through [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution) while tracking throughput in [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring).
5. **Validate** with read-only mounts from [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive) so stakeholders can double-check Dropbox before the cutover.

## Step 1 -- Prepare Connectors and Access Controls

- Configure the Box and Dropbox OAuth remotes with delegated admin accounts. Store tokens securely by setting a config password plus OS keychain storage inside [General settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings).
- Prefix remote names (for example `box-legal`, `box-studio`, `dropbox-hq`) and document them in the job memo so change records map remotes to business units.
- Export the Box folder permission matrix and attach it to your migration ticket; it helps auditors confirm that Dropbox member folders received the correct access.

## Step 2 -- Baseline with Compare Snapshots

1. Open the dual-pane Explorer, load the Box library on the left and the empty Dropbox destination on the right.
2. Run **Compare** to capture object counts, sizes, and timestamps. Save the report for compliance teams.
3. Highlight stale folders and decide whether they should land in Dropbox or a cold archive bucket.

The Compare snapshot is your starting inventory and becomes the reference for later delta runs.

## Step 3 -- Seed Copy Jobs and Preserve Metadata

- Build Copy jobs for each business unit using the templates in [Create sync jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs); Copy ensures Box remains untouched.
- Enable Box Docs filters (documented in the same guide) so ephemeral Box Notes or website shortcuts do not clutter Dropbox.
- Turn on retries, checksum verification, and `--backup-dir dropbox:/_box-deletes` so removed files stay recoverable during the coexistence period.
- Run each job once manually, observe throughput in [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring), and adjust `transfers`/`checkers` to respect Box limits.

## Step 4 -- Automate Delta Windows with Scheduler

Open **Scheduler**, enable it globally, and assign the following cadences (all documented in [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution)):

- **Intraday mini-syncs** for fast-changing folders (creative briefs, deal rooms). Keep concurrency low to avoid Box throttling.
- **Nightly full sync** for the rest of the library so Dropbox is always within a few minutes of Box before the final cutover.
- **Daily Compare-only job** that emails or messages drift summaries when users keep editing after the freeze notice.

Scheduler gives you centralized visibility: missed runs are highlighted, and every execution is logged for audits.

## Step 5 -- Cutover and Mount-Based QA

1. Announce a write freeze for Box (read-only access stays available) and trigger the final Sync + Compare sequence.
2. Mount the Dropbox destination read-only via [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive) so business owners can validate folder depth, previews, and sharing shortcuts.
3. Update bookmarks, Dropbox groups, and automation scripts. Keep the Box remote for two weeks in read-only mode for safety.
4. Export job histories from [Execute and manage job](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job) and attach them to your migration record.

## Compliance Runbook

| Cadence | RcloneView action | Evidence produced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nightly | Scheduler Copy job from Box to Dropbox + Compare report | Transfer log (CSV), Compare export, checksum summary |
| Weekly | Checksum verification (see [Checksum-Verified Cloud Migrations](https://rcloneview.com/support/blog/2025-11-18-checksum-verified-cloud-migrations-rcloneview)) | `rclone check` log, remediation notes |
| Cutover day | Manual Sync + Compare + mount-based validation | Screenshot of mount, execution log, stakeholder sign-off |
| 2 weeks post | Archive Box remote to Wasabi/S3 via Copy job for legal hold | Job memo, backup-dir inventory, retention ticket |

## FAQ

**Does RcloneView keep file versions or comments from Box?**  
File contents, timestamps, and hashes copy over, but Box version history stays in Box. Export version reports from Box and store them next to the RcloneView logs for full evidence.

**What if Box throttles or Dropbox rejects bursts?**  
Lower `--transfers` and `--checkers`, set bandwidth caps, and let Scheduler stagger jobs across time zones. Monitor retries in [Execute and manage job](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job) and capture lessons learned in your runbook.

**Can I keep Box and Dropbox in sync long term?**  
Yes. Leave the Sync job enabled weekly or monthly, or switch to Compare-only mode so you can spot new Box edits without moving data. Multi-window workflows (/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/multi-window) make it easy to drag specific projects across both clouds when stakeholders request it.

RcloneView turns rclone's enterprise engines into a guided control panel, letting you migrate Box to Dropbox with zero downtime, transparent deltas, and documented checkpoints for every audit.
