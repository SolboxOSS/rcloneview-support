# Back Up Nextcloud and WebDAV Drives with RcloneView: Visual Syncs, Schedules, and Integrity Checks

> Keep your Nextcloud or any WebDAV drive safe by mirroring it to Google Drive, S3/Wasabi, or another cloud—no command line required. RcloneView previews changes, schedules jobs, and verifies integrity so backups stay trustworthy.

Nextcloud and other WebDAV services power team shares and self-hosted storage, but they still need off-site backups. RcloneView wraps the rclone engine in a GUI, letting you add WebDAV once, pair it with your destination cloud, and automate verified backups with Job Scheduler and Compare.

## Why back up WebDAV/Nextcloud with RcloneView

- Visualize differences before syncing with **Compare** to avoid overwrites.
- Reuse the same WebDAV remote to back up to multiple targets (Drive, S3, Wasabi).
- Schedule recurring backups and keep logs in Job History.
- Use `rclone check` or checksum options to confirm data integrity.

## Connect your WebDAV/Nextcloud remote

1. Click **`+ New Remote`** → choose **WebDAV**.
2. Enter your **URL**, **username**, **password/app password**, and select the right vendor preset (e.g., Nextcloud).
3. Name it clearly, like `Nextcloud_Main`.

Need reference? See the WebDAV section in remote setup guides: [/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login) (use WebDAV option).

## Pick a backup destination

- **Google Drive / Workspace** for easy sharing and history.
- **S3-compatible** clouds (Amazon S3, Wasabi, R2) for predictable costs and lifecycle rules.
- **Another WebDAV** for simple mirror copies.

Add the destination remote with `+ New Remote`, then open both in **Explorer → Browse** side-by-side.

## Preview before you copy

- Select source (WebDAV) and destination folders in Explorer.
- Click **Compare** to highlight missing, newer, or identical items.
- Use **Copy →** or **← Copy** to move only what you need, or delete stray files safely.

## Run a one-time backup with Sync

1. Select source/destination folders.
2. Click **Sync** and enable **Dry run** first to see planned changes.
3. For large libraries, start with moderate parallelism (e.g., `--transfers=4 --checkers=8`).
4. Watch progress in **Transfer** and **Completed** tabs; review API logs if needed.

## Schedule recurring backups (set it and forget it)

1. In the Sync dialog, click **Save to Jobs** (or open **Job Manager → Add Job**).
2. Choose frequency (nightly, weekdays) and keep a **backup-dir/versioned** folder if you want point-in-time restores.
3. Turn on notifications and monitor **Job History** for success/fail details.

## Strengthen integrity and reliability

- Use **Compare** regularly to spot drift before it matters.
- Run `rclone check source: dest:` in the built-in Terminal for checksum validation on supported backends.
- Keep the WebDAV server stable: ensure HTTPS, valid certs, and avoid throttling by spacing schedules.
- Store `rclone_view.db` in a safe, user-writable location for reliable logs/history (see: [/support/tutorials/change-rcloneview-database-location](/support/tutorials/change-rcloneview-database-location)).

## Quick FAQ

**Does this work for any WebDAV, not just Nextcloud?**  
Yes—select WebDAV and the appropriate vendor/preset or “other” to match your service.

**Can I back up to multiple destinations?**  
Yes—reuse the same WebDAV source in multiple jobs (e.g., Nextcloud → Drive and Nextcloud → Wasabi).

**Do scheduled jobs run if the app is locked?**  
Jobs run as configured; App Lock simply protects UI access (see [/support/tutorials/enable-app-lock](/support/tutorials/enable-app-lock)).

## Wrap-up

RcloneView makes WebDAV/Nextcloud backups visual and predictable: add the remote once, preview changes, tune performance, and schedule verified jobs. Protect your team’s files with off-site copies you can trust—no CLI fluency required.
