# Encrypt pCloud Files with RcloneView — Easy GUI for rclone crypt

> Keep pCloud data private with rclone crypt, minus the command-line learning curve. RcloneView gives you a guided UI to create encrypted remotes, run verified transfers, and restore safely.

pCloud already offers built-in security, but some teams need zero-knowledge encryption they fully control. RcloneView wraps rclone’s `crypt` in a friendly workflow: connect pCloud, add an encrypted layer, sync or mount it, and keep an audit trail with logs and checksums.

## What Is crypt?

`crypt` is rclone’s client-side encryption. It wraps any remote (like pCloud) so filenames and content are encrypted before upload. You hold the keys; pCloud only stores ciphertext.

## Why Encrypt pCloud?

- Zero-knowledge posture: you control keys; providers cannot read content.
- Compliance: encrypt sensitive folders (finance, HR, legal) before they leave devices.
- Safety net: even if a link leaks, files stay unreadable without your passphrase.

## Step-by-Step: Encrypt pCloud with RcloneView

1) Connect pCloud
- Add pCloud via `+ New Remote` (WebDAV/OAuth). Guide: [add-oath-online-login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login).
- Verify the remote in **Remote Explorer** to confirm access.

1) Create the crypt layer
- In **Remote Manager**, create a new remote of type **crypt**, pointing to your pCloud remote path (e.g., `pcloud:/secure/`).
- Choose filename encryption (standard) and set a strong passphrase. Save it securely.

1) Optional: Mount the encrypted remote
- Open **Mount Manager** and select the crypt remote to browse in Explorer/Finder without downloading everything: [mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive).
- Windows: pick a drive letter; macOS: pick a mount path.



1) Sync or copy data into the encrypted path
- Use **copy** for the first load; switch to **sync** once validated: [create-sync-jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs).
- For smaller scopes, drag/drop via Remote Explorer, or build a job per folder (e.g., Finance, Legal, Projects).

1) Validate before and after
- Run **Compare** to spot newer/missing files before running a sync: [compare-folder-contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents).
- Enable checksum verification in job options for integrity.

## Conclusion

Encrypting pCloud with RcloneView takes minutes: add pCloud, wrap it with crypt, copy or sync data, and schedule ongoing protection. You keep the keys, RcloneView handles the heavy lifting.
