# From NAS to Cloud: Automate Synology & QNAP Backups with RcloneView

> Protect your NAS data with zero scripting. Use **RcloneView** to connect **Synology** or **QNAP** devices directly to your favorite cloud storage‚Äî**Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, **Amazon S3**, or **WebDAV**‚Äîand schedule automatic off-site backups.

## Why back up your NAS to the cloud

NAS systems like Synology and QNAP are perfect for local storage, media libraries, and file sharing‚Äîbut they‚Äôre still vulnerable to theft, fire, or hardware failure. Off-site cloud backups add a critical layer of protection by ensuring your data survives even if your NAS doesn‚Äôt.

**RcloneView** gives NAS owners an easy way to automate that process, with:
- **No command line setup**
- **Drag-and-drop transfers**
- **Visual sync previews**
- **Scheduled backups**
- **Support for 40+ cloud providers**

## Step 1 ‚Äî Preparation

Before starting your backup setup:

1. **Enable network access on your NAS**  
   - For **Synology**, enable **WebDAV Server** or **S3-compatible service** in DSM.  
   - For **QNAP**, use **Hybrid Backup Sync (HBS3)** or enable **WebDAV/S3** in App Center.  

2. **Plan your backup targets**  
   - `/homes/` or `/photo/` for personal data  
   - `/projects/` or `/shared/` for team folders  

3. **Check available storage space** on your chosen cloud provider.  

4. **Decide your schedule** ‚Äî daily syncs, weekly archives, or continuous mirroring.

RcloneView‚Äôs setup wizard makes connecting NAS and cloud accounts straightforward.

1. Open **RcloneView** ‚Üí click **`+ New Remote`**.  
2. Select your **cloud provider** (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Wasabi).  
3. Follow the sign-in or API key prompts, then give it a recognizable name (e.g., `MyS3Backup` or `Drive-Archive`).  
4. On the left **Local tab**, browse to your **mounted NAS directory** or connect to your NAS using WebDAV or other supported protocols.
5. Confirm both sides (Local NAS and Cloud Remote) are visible in the Explorer panel.

## Step 3 ‚Äî Automate your NAS ‚Üí Cloud backup

Choose the method that fits your workflow:

### A) **Drag & Drop (One-time copy)**  
Drag folders from your NAS side to the cloud remote pane for quick uploads. Perfect for ad-hoc backups or small archives.

---

### B) **Compare & Copy (Incremental updates)**  
Preview what‚Äôs new, changed, or missing before syncing. Copy only updated files to minimize bandwidth usage.
