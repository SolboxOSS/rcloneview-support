# RcloneView Compliance-Ready Cloud Journaling Blueprint for Regulated Teams

> Every examination demands a replay of who touched which file, when it changed, and where the latest copy lives today.

Financial, healthcare, broadcast, and legal teams live and die by audit-ready evidence. Regulators expect journaled copies of SaaS activity with immutable retention, but native tools rarely scale across tenants, regions, or complex folder trees. RcloneView layers a visual workflow on top of rclone so you can capture every mutation across Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox, Box, S3, Wasabi, or on-prem shares without writing scripts.

With multi-cloud Explorer panes, Compare previews, Sync/Copy/Mount templates, and a reliable scheduler, you can build an always-on journal that feeds warm storage for restores and cold storage for legal holds using the same declarative job.

## Why Regulated Teams Need a Cloud Journal Layer

- **Evidence clocks never stop**: SEC 17a-4, HIPAA, CJIS, and SOC 2 demand that deleted or amended files remain discoverable for 5–10 years with provable checksums.
- **Multi-cloud reality**: Marketing thrives in Google Drive, finance locks spreadsheets in OneDrive, engineers archive to S3 or Wasabi. Manual exports cannot keep every silo in sync.
- **Ransomware and insider edits**: Without immutable, verified journals you cannot show when tampering happened or prove that remediation copies stayed untouched.

RcloneView centralizes those needs by orchestrating rclone's mature transports behind a GUI that anyone on compliance, IT, or DevOps can run.

## Blueprint: Multi-Cloud Evidence Vault Powered by RcloneView

1. **Multi-cloud collectors** — Register every tenant, share, and bucket in [Remote Manager](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/remote-manager) using vendor-specific guides such as [Add SharePoint for Business](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/connect-using-cli/add-sharepoint-for-business) or [Add Google Shared Drive](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/connect-using-cli/add-google-shared-drive). Connection templates keep refresh tokens isolated per business unit.
2. **Journal pipelines** — Use the Copy and Sync recipes from [Create Sync Jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs) and [Synchronize Remote Storages](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/synchronize-remote-storages) to mirror production folders into S3, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, or Cloudflare R2 buckets with Object Lock turned on.
3. **Controlled reviewer access** — Legal or audit teams mount vaults in read-only mode via [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive) so they can open exhibits without copying data elsewhere.

This pattern satisfies the multi-cloud, compare, sync, mount, and scheduler pillars baked into RcloneView's product DNA.

## Step 1 — Harden Connectors and Identity Controls

- Launch Remote Manager and add service accounts for each regulated workload. The per-provider wizards ensure OAuth scopes stay minimal while still supporting journaling.
- Visit [General Settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings) to set a config password so rclone configuration files remain encrypted at rest.
- Label remotes by business unit (`workspace-journal`, `sharepoint-clients`, `wasabi-litigation`) and keep their root paths scoped to only the folders that need journaling. See [Browse and manage remote storage](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/browse-and-manage-remote-storage) for naming conventions.
- When a platform lacks APIs (legacy SMB, lab NAS), mount it once with system credentials and expose the path through RcloneView; the journal job treats it like another remote.

Once connectors are locked down, export an encrypted backup of your `rclone.conf` and drop it into the immutable vault for disaster recovery.

## Step 2 — Build Write-Once Journaling Jobs

RcloneView's job designer lets you choose Copy, Sync, or Move. For compliance, use Copy for append-only vaults and Sync when the evidence repository must reflect live folder state (paired with Object Lock or versioned buckets).

1. Open **Jobs → New** and select the Copy or Sync template documented in [Create Sync Jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs).
2. Pick source and target remotes in the dual-pane Explorer. Use [Compare folder contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents) to preview additions, removals, and changed hashes before anything is written.

## Step 3 — Automate Evidence Capture with Scheduler

The scheduler keeps journals running even when laptops sleep or admins rotate. Open **Scheduler → Enable** (documented in [Job scheduling and execution](/support/howto/rcloneview-advanced/job-scheduling-and-execution)) and assign cadences per job:

- **Intraday** for trading desks or collaborative design folders. Limit concurrency to avoid API throttles and cap bandwidth so production traffic stays smooth.
- **Nightly** for general document hubs plus database dumps arriving on NAS shares.

## Step 4 — Verify, Seal, and Surface Proof

Verification is what convinces examiners that the journal is trustworthy:

- Watch progress via [Real-time transfer monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring) so you can capture timestamps and throughput in screenshots.
- Use [Execute and manage job](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job) to export execution logs; store them next to the journaled data for nonrepudiation.

These steps create a chain of custody that links the source workload, transfer job, verification report, and storage location.

## Suggested Compliance Runbook

| Cadence | RcloneView action | Evidence produced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Daily | Nightly Copy job (Workspace → Wasabi Object Lock) + Compare diff email | Transfer log, compare screenshot |
| Weekly | Scheduler-triggered Check job (SharePoint → S3 Glacier) | job execution export |
| Quarterly | Review scheduler matrix, rotate service credentials, and retest restores | Updated credential inventory, restore transcript |


## FAQ: Share Evidence Without Breaking Chain of Custody

**Can reviewers browse data without copying it?**  
Yes. Use Mount Manager plus the tutorial in [Mount cloud storage as a local drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive) to attach the immutable bucket in read-only mode for paralegals, QA, or regulators.


**Can we keep hot and cold copies simultaneously?**  
Absolutely. Create two destinations inside the same job: a hot Wasabi bucket for fast restores and a Glacier/R2 bucket for 7-year retention.

RcloneView turns rclone's proven engine into a guided experience so compliance, IT, and legal teams can all participate in protecting critical records. Build the journal once, schedule it, and you will always have the evidence regulators demand.
