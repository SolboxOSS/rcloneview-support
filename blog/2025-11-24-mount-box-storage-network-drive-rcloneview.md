# Mount Box Storage as a Network Drive with RcloneView for Seamless Team Access

> Stop downloading everything from Box. Mount it as a drive, browse in Explorer or Finder, and keep teams working without babysitting sync clients.

Box is excellent for collaboration, but local sync clients can bloat disks and slow laptops. With RcloneView you can mount Box as a network drive, stream files on demand, and control cache and bandwidth so teams get fast access without full downloads.

## Why Mount Box Instead of Syncing?

- Save disk space on shared devices; fetch only what users open.
- Faster onboarding: map one drive letter or mount path and skip initial bulk syncs.
- Better control: throttle bandwidth, tune cache, and log everything for audits.

## Step 1 — Connect Box in RcloneView

- Add Box via `+ New Remote` (OAuth flow). Guide: [add-oath-online-login](/support/howto/remote-storage-connection-settings/add-oath-online-login).
- Verify the remote in **Remote Explorer** so you know folders and depth look right.

## Step 2 — Mount Box as a Drive (Windows or macOS)

- Open **Mount Manager** and select your Box remote. Guide: [mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/mount-cloud-storage-as-a-local-drive).
- Choose a target:
  - Windows: assign a drive letter (e.g., `B:`) using `cmount` under the hood.
  - macOS: pick a mount path (e.g., `/Volumes/Box`).
- Save and mount; confirm the drive appears in Explorer or Finder.

## Step 3 — Tune Cache and Bandwidth for Teams

- Cache mode: set to `full` so directory browsing and seeks stay smooth.
- Cache size: allocate SSD space (5-20 GB for docs, more for media-heavy teams).
- Read ahead: add `--vfs-read-ahead 64M` in Global Rclone Flags for quicker previews. See [general-settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings).
- Bandwidth caps: keep office networks responsive by setting upload/download limits in [general-settings](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/general-settings).

## Step 4 — Use Compare Before Big Moves

- Run **Compare** to see differences between Box and a local or secondary cloud before making structural changes: [compare-folder-contents](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-folder-contents).
- Catch missing or newer files without risking an accidental overwrite.
- Save the compare job to rerun audits monthly.

## Step 5 — Optional Sync Jobs and Backups

- Mirror critical Box folders to a backup target (S3, Wasabi, NAS) with **copy** or **sync** jobs: [create-sync-jobs](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/create-sync-jobs).
- Start with copy for safety; switch to sync after validating results.
- Schedule off-hours runs so workday mounts stay snappy.

## Monitor, Audit, and Recover

- Watch live throughput and stalled files in **Transfer Monitor**: [real-time-transfer-monitoring](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/real-time-transfer-monitoring).
- Check **Job History** for successes, skips, and retries: [execute-manage-job](/support/howto/rcloneview-basic/execute-manage-job).
- If a laptop sleeps or a network drops, remount; RcloneView resumes pending transfers.

## Team Tips

- Standardize the same drive letter or mount path across users to avoid broken shortcuts.
- Use presets per department to keep includes/excludes tidy.
- Export logs when proving moves or audits to stakeholders.

Mount Box once, tune cache, and give teams a fast, low-overhead network drive without heavyweight sync clients. RcloneView keeps everything visible, logged, and easy to manage.
