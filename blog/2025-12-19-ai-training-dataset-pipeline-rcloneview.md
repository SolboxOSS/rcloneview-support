# Build an AI Training Dataset Pipeline: Efficiently Transfer Local Data to Cloud Storage with RcloneView

> Move terabytes of training data from local workstations or NAS into cloud buckets (S3, R2, HuggingFace Datasets, GCS) with GUI-based jobs, checksum validation, and scheduled deltas.

AI teams need fast, reliable ingestion into object storage. RcloneView wraps rclone’s performance flags, checksums, and retries in a visual workflow so you can ship data to your bucket once, keep it consistent with deltas, and avoid command-line fragility.

## Why RcloneView for AI dataset uploads

- No CLI surprises: configure S3/R2/GCS/HuggingFace endpoints with guided dialogs and save them as reusable remotes.
- Integrity first: checksum-aware transfers, retry logic, and post-run compares to prove your dataset arrived intact.
- High throughput, throttled safely: tune transfers, chunk sizes, and bandwidth caps per job to match lab or colocation links.
- Repeatable jobs: schedule nightly deltas from local SSD/NAS, monitor progress, and export logs for compliance.

## Prerequisites

- RcloneView installed where the data resides (workstation, NAS gateway, or a jump box with access to local storage).
- Cloud bucket credentials (AWS S3 keys, R2 tokens, HuggingFace CLI token, or GCS service account).
- Enough outbound bandwidth or a staging disk to batch uploads.

## Step 1 — Add remotes for your target buckets

1) Open **Settings ? Remote Storage** and click **Add**.

2) Choose your target:
   - **S3 / S3-compatible** for AWS, MinIO, or R2.
   - **WebDAV / HTTP** if pushing to HuggingFace Spaces that expose WebDAV (or use S3-compatible if enabled).
   - **GCS** for Google Cloud buckets.
3) Paste keys/tokens, select the bucket, and test the connection.

## Step 2 — Stage your local dataset for transfer

- Point RcloneView to the local root directory (e.g., `/datasets/imagenet/` or a mounted NAS share).
- Clean obvious issues: zero-byte placeholders, temp files, or paths that exceed 255 chars on the destination.
- If you keep annotations or manifests, place them alongside the data so they are versioned together.

## Step 3 — Validate structure with side-by-side Explorer

- Open the local folder on the left pane and the target bucket path on the right.

- Use **Compare** to preview what will be created in the bucket.  
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-basic/compare-display-select.png" alt="Compare shared folder and My Drive contents" class="img-large img-center" />
- Copy a small shard (e.g., a single class folder) first to verify ACLs and naming before the big push.

## Step 4 — Build a checksum-verified upload job

1) Create a **Sync** or **Copy** job from the local root to the bucket prefix (e.g., `s3:ai-training/imagenet/`).  
2) Enable checksum use (ETag/MD5/SHA1 as supported) and keep retries on.  
3) Set **Transfers** and **Bandwidth Limit** to saturate your link without triggering provider throttling.

## Step 5 — Run and monitor at scale

- Start the job and watch throughput, ETA, and any retries in real time.

- If targeting R2 or S3 with small files, bump chunk size and parallelism; for huge binaries, increase chunk size but keep concurrency modest to avoid 429s.
- Use **Job History** to export logs as proof-of-ingest for your MLOps ticket or compliance runbook.

## Step 6 — Schedule nightly deltas

- Create a second job that syncs only changes (new data, fixed labels) and schedule it during low-traffic hours.  
<img src="/support/images/en/howto/rcloneview-advanced/create-job-schedule.png" alt="create job schedule" class="img-large img-center" />
- Keep the original full-upload job disabled; rerun it only for major re-ingests.

## Step 7 — Fast fixes with drag-and-drop

- For quick patch uploads (hotfix annotations, a few shards), drag files from local to the bucket pane; RcloneView will handle checksums and retries automatically.

## Step 8 — Optional: Mount buckets for spot checks

- Mount the bucket as a drive to verify samples directly from training nodes without redownloading.

- Use it to confirm file integrity in-place or to stream small validation sets.

## Troubleshooting for AI pipelines

- **Checksum mismatches**: rerun compare, then retry only failed objects from history; check for antivirus or filesystem locks on the local side.
- **Throughput stalls**: lower concurrency for R2, raise chunk size for GCS/S3, or cap bandwidth to avoid ISP shaping.
- **Token/credential expiry**: rotate keys in the remote config once; all dependent jobs inherit the new credentials.
