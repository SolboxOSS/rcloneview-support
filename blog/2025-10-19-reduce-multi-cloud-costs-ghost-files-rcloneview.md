# Reduce Multi-Cloud Costs: Identify and Clean Up Ghost Files with RcloneView’s Compare Tool

> Stop paying for duplicate or forgotten data across Google Drive, S3, R2, and Dropbox. RcloneView’s Compare tool lets you visually spot and remove ghost files to shrink your monthly bill.

Cloud sprawl hits budgets first: overlapping backups, legacy project folders, and stale exports that nobody remembers. With RcloneView you can audit two remotes side by side, surface duplicates, and archive or delete safely—no CLI required and with logs you can keep for finance.

## Why ghost files cost so much

- Redundant copies across premium tiers (Google Drive + S3 Standard) quietly double spend.
- Forgotten exports and media archives linger on expensive storage classes.
- Teams lose track of “final” versions, keeping every draft forever.

## What you need

- RcloneView installed and signed in to the two remotes you want to audit (e.g., `gdrive:` and `s3:` or `r2:`).
- Enough permissions to list and delete/move objects on the target remotes.
- Optional: a cheaper archive bucket (Wasabi, S3 Glacier, R2) for long-term retention.

## Step 1 — Open both clouds side by side

1) Connect your remotes in **Settings ? Remote Storage** (Google Drive, S3/R2, Dropbox, etc.).

2) Open the **Explorer** and load each remote in its own pane.

## Step 2 — Run Compare to surface ghost files

- Click **Compare** to analyze names, sizes, and (when available) checksums.

- Results show:
  - **Identical files** in both remotes (likely redundant).
  - **Left only / Right only** items (orphaned data).
  - **Different** items with the same name but different content.

Tip: Start with large folders (media, backups) for quick savings.

## Step 3 — Clean up safely

- Delete duplicates on the expensive side, or move them into a cheaper archive bucket.  
- Use **Drag & Drop** to relocate files before deleting so you keep one canonical copy.

- For sensitive data, copy to archive first, verify, then delete the original to avoid accidental loss.

## Step 4 — Prevent future bloat with scheduled syncs

- Create a **Sync** job from your primary storage to a backup or archive remote.  
- Enable deletes (with care) so removed items don’t linger and keep accruing cost.  
- Schedule the job during off-hours; keep bandwidth limits low for cheap egress.

## Step 5 — Monitor and keep an audit trail

- Watch transfers live to catch rate limits or unexpected large moves.

- Use **Job History** to export logs for finance or compliance, proving what was deleted or archived.

## Tier-and-save playbook

- Keep “hot” working sets on Google Drive/Dropbox.  
- Push stale or infrequently accessed data to S3 Glacier, Wasabi, or R2.  
- Re-run **Compare** monthly to catch new ghost files before they snowball into higher plan tiers.
