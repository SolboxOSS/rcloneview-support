# Multi-Cloud Backup Strategy with RcloneView: Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, and NAS

> Keep redundant copies across clouds and on-prem without scripting. RcloneView gives you a GUI for Google Drive, OneDrive, S3-compatible storage, and NAS so you can design nightly backups, verify checksums, and monitor retries from one place.

## Why multi-cloud backup?

- **Resilience:** One provider outage or account lockout won’t halt access to your data.
- **Cost control:** Mix low-cost object storage (S3/Wasabi) with collaboration clouds (Google Drive/OneDrive).
- **Performance:** Keep a nearby NAS copy for fast restores, while keeping a cloud copy for off-site safety.
- **Compliance:** Separate copies reduce single points of failure and simplify retention policies.

## What you can back up with RcloneView

- **Google Drive / Shared Drives** (OAuth, no tokens to paste).
- **OneDrive / SharePoint** (OAuth).
- **S3-compatible**: Amazon S3, Wasabi, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2 (access/secret keys).
- **NAS / SMB / NFS**: mount as a local path, or use SFTP/SMB remotes.
- **External drives** for offline or air-gapped copies.

## Sync vs. Backup: choose the right mode

- **Sync**: keeps source and destination matched. Ideal for working sets but can propagate deletes. Use with care for backups.
- **Backup-style one-way copy**: copy new/changed files only; do not delete at destination. Safer for historical backups.

## Build an automated backup job (example: Drive → S3 → NAS)

1. Open **Remote → + New Remote** and add Google Drive, OneDrive, and S3.  
2. In **Browse**, open your source (e.g., Google Drive) in the left pane and target (S3 bucket) in the right pane.  
3. Click **Sync** (or **Copy** via toolbar) and choose **one-way source → destination**.  
4. Set filters: exclude temp/cache folders, include key folders, and enable **checksum** if the target supports it.  
5. Click **Save to Jobs** and name it (e.g., `drive-to-s3-backup`).  
6. Repeat for **OneDrive → S3** or **S3 → NAS** if you want a local secondary copy.

## Schedule nightly backups (daily 02:00)

1. Open **Job Manager → Add Job**.  
2. Select your saved job (e.g., `drive-to-s3-backup`).  
3. Set schedule to **Daily** at **02:00**.

## Monitor failures and retries

- Open the **Transfer** tab during runs to watch throughput and retry counts.  
- Check **Job History/Logs** to see which files failed and why.

## Best practices for a reliable multi-cloud backup

- Keep at least **2–3 copies** across different providers/media.  
- Use **one-way copy** to backup targets; avoid propagating deletes until you have confirmed retention.  
- On NAS, ensure the volume has sufficient snapshots or RAID protection.  
- Periodically **test restores** from each target to validate integrity and permissions.  
- Document schedules and destinations so audits and handoffs are easy.

## Summary

RcloneView makes multi-cloud backups practical: connect Google Drive, OneDrive, S3, Wasabi, and NAS; design one-way copy or sync flows; enable checksum verification; and schedule nightly runs—all without CLI scripts. With clear logs and retries, you can maintain redundant copies and recover quickly when something goes wrong.
